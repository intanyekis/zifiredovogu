This movie, which launched Macaulay Culkin to international stardom, is considered one of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">best Christmas movies of all time</a>, according to Rotten Tomatoes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like the movie, the story behind the making of Home Alone is filled with funny and interesting stories. For example, did you know that <a href=# rel=nofollow>Chris Columbus’ disdain for Chevy Chase</a> is what led to him directing this Christmas classic movie? Or that Michael Jackson would constantly visit the set of Home Alone 2?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>'Home Alone’ Was Nearly Cancelled During Production</a></span></p><h2 id=home-alone-was-a-huge-commercial-success>Home Alone Was A Huge Commercial Success</h2><p>Directed by Chris Columbus and written and produced by John Hugh, Home Alone is now considered a Christmas classic.</p><p>The first movie of this successful franchise stars Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister, a boy who’s accidentally left alone at home for the holidays and has to defend his suburban Chicago home from burglars all by himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Home Alone premiered in November 1990, and it received positive reviews, with high praise for its cast, humor, and music. It was such a success that it was nominated for numerous awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and the Academy Award for Best Original Score for John Williams’ work in the movie.</p><p>In addition to critical success, Home Alone was a huge commercial hit. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Box Office Mojo</a>, the first movie grossed out more than $476 million worldwide, and its sequel, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Home Alone 2: Lost in New York</a> (1992), made almost $360 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Is Macaulay Culkin Still Making Royalties From His Iconic Role In Home Alone Today?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And as for why the Home Alone movies became such beloved Christmas classics, it could be for the same reasons why Chris Columbus decided to direct the first movie.</p><p>"Home Alone appealed to me in the same way Gremlins appealed to me," Columbus admitted. "A lot of people consider Christmas the happiest and most emotional time of the year and I love the contrast of setting a movie like Gremlins or Home Alone against that backdrop. To me, what’s going on in Home Alone is the polar opposite of Christmas but set against that particular backdrop, it becomes a new beast."</p><h2 id=home-alone-star-macaulay-culkin-had-an-unexpected-friendship-with-michael-jackson>Home Alone Star, Macaulay Culkin Had An Unexpected Friendship With Michael Jackson</h2><p>This led to the Home Alone star meeting the biggest celebrities of the moment, including Michael Jackson, the King of Pop. It all started when Culkin starred in the music video for Jackson’s single Black and White.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both stars seemed to bond over the fact that they both started their careers at a young age, and didn’t really get to have a real childhood because of that. Culkin and Jackson became lifelong friends and the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Home Alone star defended the king of pop</a> several times from allegations against Jackson of sexual abuse.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>A Look Back At Macaulay Culkin’s Relationship With Michael Jackson</a></span></p><h2 id=michael-jackson-constantly-visited-the-home-alone-2-set>Michael Jackson Constantly Visited The Home Alone 2 Set</h2><p>There are plenty of interesting facts about the making of the Home Alone movies. One of them is the fact that the King of Pop himself would often visit the set when the cast and crew were filming the Home Alone sequel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Daniel Clancy, who worked as a set designer for the movie, told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Metro UK News</a> that Michael Jackson would often pop on the set to check in on Macaulay Culkin. And during one of these visits, the King of Pop got roped into appearing in a home movie Devin Ratray, who played Buzz McCallister, was filming.</p><p>“I was shooting a homemade documentary with my giant video camera and Macaulay brought me up to him and said, “Can Devin interview you?” Surprisingly, without hesitating, Michael said, “Sure.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We had to pause whilst rehearsing because Michael had to use the bathroom. Nobody even knew he was coming to set, let alone that I’d be able to interview him. He had a music video out at the time called “Do You Remember” and in it, he kisses Iman. I didn’t know what to ask so I said, “Hey, how was that kiss with Iman?” He just burst out laughing. As soon as that happened, he immediately let his guard down and we talked normally – as completely insane and outlandish as that situation was,” Ratray told the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Independent</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brnInJ%2BanZxit6Kvyqymp2WnnbKveceeZLCZnKCypXnOp2StoJVitbC5xGaYpaeemnq0sdNo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-michael-jackson-when-he-walked-on-the-home-alone-set.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-to-michael-jackson-when-he-walked-on-the-home-alone-set.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-michael-jackson-when-he-walked-on-the-home-alone-set.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-to-michael-jackson-when-he-walked-on-the-home-alone-set.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-michael-jackson-when-he-walked-on-the-home-alone-set.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-michael-jackson-when-he-walked-on-the-home-alone-set.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-jesus-ortiz-paz-fans-think-he-has-a-girlfriend-called-jailyne-ojeda-489132-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-jesus-ortiz-paz-fans-think-he-has-a-girlfriend-called-jailyne-ojeda-489132-html.html>Why Jesus Ortiz Paz Fans Think He Has A Girlfriend Called Jailyne Ojeda</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-financial-tapestry-of-carla-dibello-unveiling-her-net-worth.html>The Financial Tapestry Of Carla Dibello: Unveiling Her Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-financial-tapestry-of-carla-dibello-unveiling-her-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
