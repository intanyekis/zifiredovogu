The host announced his retirement from the show on the cusp of recording its 41st season, which means the season will be the last for Pat Sajak.</p><p>As SONY went on a recruiting call to find a suitable to replace Pat, fans speculated excitedly who could be a perfect replacement for Pat. After internal deals, <a href=#>Ryan Seacrest was announced as the show's new hire</a>. He will take over Pat's hosting duties in September 2024 at the start of a new season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Pat is planning for his retirement, co-host Vanna White has yet to finalize her contract.

However, she had to take a step back from an episode because she was sick.</p><p>Vanna is no stranger to being under the weather, but this time, after contracting COVID-19 in late July, she was advised to step back. Instead of the regular "Teacher's Week" episode, the production team invited "Teacher of the Year" Bridgette Donald-Blue to host.
