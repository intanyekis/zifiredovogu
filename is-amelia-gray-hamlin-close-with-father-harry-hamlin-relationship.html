But this could be because Harry tries to live more privately than his wife Lisa Rinna does. Amelia has shared a few posts thanking Lisa for being a great mom over the years.</p><p>It's possible that fans might see more of Lisa and Harry. After the recent announcement that Lisa Rinna is leaving The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, Page Six reported another potential reality series.</p><p>Delilah Belle explained to Page Six, "There’s a show. It involves cooking. I don’t know if I’m allowed to say that but there you go.” Delilah said that her parents will be the cast members. RHOBH fans know that Harry Hamlin is an incredible cook.

There is a scene where I am EXTREMELY rude to my dad and the food that he wants me to eat. During that time, one year ago — I was not in a good place at all. I may have looked like I was recovered, but I was most definitely not. Within the scene you will see me lashing out due to my fear of food.”</p><p>Amelia continued, “The person displayed in tonight’s episode is not the person I am. It was the person anorexia made me… I just wanted everyone to know why I acted the way that I did."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/amelia-gray-hamlin-family.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While this was a heartbreaking scene to watch, it does capture the realistic nature of struggling with an eating disorder.
