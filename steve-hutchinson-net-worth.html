After moving from defensive tackle to offensive guard during his redshirt year in 1996, he was given a starting spot on the 1997 Michigan squad that went on to win the Associated Press national championship.</p><strong>Steve Hutchinson</strong> has an estimated net worth of <strong>$18 million dollars</strong>, as of 2023. Hutchinson signed a contentious offer sheet from the Vikings, worth $49 million over seven years. At the time, this deal was thought to be the most lucrative guard contract ever presented.<p>Hutchinson was a starter for all four years of his time at Michigan and did not give up a single sack during his last two years with the Wolverines. He was a two-year team captain, a four-year All-Big Ten selection, the Big Ten Offensive Lineman of the Year, and a two-time All-American, including receiving unanimous first-team All-American accolades as a senior in the year 2000. In addition, he was the Big Ten Offensive Lineman of the Year. Additionally, the Touchdown Club of Columbus bestowed its Jim Parker Award onto him, and he was a nominee for the Outland Trophy.</p><p>Landyn was Hutchinson’s high school love, and they got married. The couple’s children include a son named Luke and a girl named Lily. Hutchinson has a second property on Key Largo, which is located in Florida. He is a passionate outdoorsman who enjoys fishing and hunting. Hutchinson and his family currently make their home in Nashville, Tennessee, where his wife formerly had a retail store that was doomed to fail and was eventually shut down a year ago. In Seattle, his family developed a close relationship with the family of Vikings legend John Randle, and they continue to be good friends.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"></figure><p>Hutchinson played for the Seattle Seahawks for the first five seasons of his professional football career. The Seahawks selected Hutchinson in the first round of the 2001 NFL Draft. Hutchinson, who was a free agent at the time, was designated as Seattle’s transition player in March of 2006.</p><p>While playing for the Seahawks, Hutchinson was named to the Pro Bowl three times and to the All-Pro team three times. On the route to the Seahawks’ appearance in Super Bowl XL, where they were defeated by the Pittsburgh Steelers 21-10, he was also a vital lineman who blocked for Shaun Alexander during his MVP season in 2005. In that season, Shaun Alexander won the award for Most Valuable Player. This would be his last game playing for the Seattle Seahawks before leaving the team.</p><p>The National Football League had rules in place at the time that said if a team signed a player with the transition tag to an offer sheet, the player’s previous team was forced to either match the terms of the offer sheet exactly or give up their rights to the player. Although the franchise tag was not activated during his time with the Vikings (he was released by the Vikings in March 2012), the Seahawks had just recently given tackle Walter Jones a contract that was richer than the one offered to Hutchinson. Hutchinson was offered a contract that was worth less than Jones’.</p><p>On December 21, 2010, the Vikings placed Hutchinson on injured reserve as a precautionary measure. As the 2011 NFL season came to a close, Hutchinson was placed on injured reserve. During the first 11 years of his career in the National Football League (NFL), Hutchinson started each of the 157 games that he participated in. On March 10, 2012, the Minnesota Vikings made the decision to declare that they would no longer be employing Hutchinson. Hutchinson had a meeting with the Seattle Seahawks on March 14, 2012, in order to discuss the possibility of a deal with his previous team. On March 11, 2013, Hutchinson made the announcement that he will be retiring. His induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame is scheduled to take place on February 1, 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsZeau6rB0meaqKVfqMGmwsRmn66sk522r7%2FOp2SnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsteve-hutchinson-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsteve-hutchinson-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsteve-hutchinson-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsteve-hutchinson-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsteve-hutchinson-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsteve-hutchinson-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./eric-berry-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./eric-berry-net-worth.html>Eric Berry Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./eslam-elmasry.html>Eslam Elmasry</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./eslam-elmasry.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
