While the drama is usually between the contestants, it appears as if there are a handful of queens who have come for RuPaul, and here's who made the list!</p><h2 id=willam><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Willam</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Willam is easily one of the biggest names to reign from RuPaul's Drag Race, however, she is notoriously known for her feud with the Queen of Drag. Willam ended up getting <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">kicked off the show</a> as she broke the rules following a number of conjugal visits from her husband.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Best Celebrity Judges On ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’</a></span></p><p>Willam claims she did it intentionally as she wanted no part of the season any longer. Although the tense season feud was assumed to be about rule-breaking, it appears ad if Ru and Willam had it out in public prior to filming where Ru was called out for reportedly not visiting Mathu Andersen in the hospital, a longtime friend of RuPaul's.</p><h2 id=tammie><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Tammie</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tammie Brown has one of the very first public spats with RuPaul during the very first season reunion. While fans forgot about the argument, it came back to life when Lego re-aired the season. During the sit-down reunion, Tammie asked why Ru and the fellow judges constantly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">honed on the negativity</a>&nbsp;when it came to her looks throughout the season.</p><p>After reminding Tammie she was on a reality TV show where critique is necessary. RuPaul then changed their demeanor and had a very pointed attitude towards Tammie.&nbsp;“It’s not my responsibility to make you feel good all the time," Ru told her. Tammie's response to Ru was one fan will never forget!&nbsp;You called me a loser, and I don’t see you out there walking children in nature.” *Drops Mic*.</p><h2 id=gia-gunn><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Gia Gunn</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gia Gunn and RuPaul have had it out before, however, it appears as if the scene never saw the light of day. Ru made comments regarding no longer wanting to have trans women who have begun their gender-affirming transition to participate in the show. Considering Gia is a trans woman, she clearly took offense to such harsh words.</p><p>"To now hear such words of segregation from an icon who has created a worldwide community of unity, makes me sad," Gia said. Gunn went on to say that queens should be judged on their talent and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not their gender identity</a>, and she certainly had a point!</p><h2 id=pearl><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Pearl</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pearl first appeared on our screens back in season 7 of RPDR, and while she was a fan favorite who brought looks, wit, and dry humor to the show, that certainly wasn't enough to charm Ru. The duo had quite a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tense workroom standoff</a> which led to Pearl uttering one of the most iconic lines to date.</p><p>"Do I have something on my face?" she asked Ru. While fans were confused as to where the animosity stemmed from, Pearl revealed that at some point during filming, RuPaul had allegedly told her "nothing you say matters unless that camera is rolling," which didn't sit well with her at all.</p><h2 id=delta-work><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Delta Work</span></h2><p>Delta Work made a name for herself back on season 3 of RuPaul's Drag Race, however, despite her success on the series, Delta felt incredibly abandoned and let down by both Ru and production following her time on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During an interview with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Race Chaser</a>&nbsp;podcast, Delta revealed that Ru had snubbed her when it came to nominating Delta for her time on season 10 and claimed both RuPaul and the team behind the show cut off all communication with her. Yikes!</p><h2 id=the-vixen><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Vixen</span></h2><p>The Vixen and RuPaul had one of the most heated exchanges in Drag Race herstory! While The Vixen had it out with a number of queens during the season, including Eureka and Aquaria, it was her tiff with Ru that made headlines.</p><p>During the season 10 reunion, The Vixen and Ru fought over their difference of opinions when it came to how drag queens of color had to act in a certain way in order to advance in the industry. Ru didn't agree, causing the two to spar. While the other queens sat in silence, The Vixen couldn't take it any longer and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">walked out of the reunion!</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=carmen-carrera><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Carmen Carrera</span></h2><p>Carmen Carrera joined the series back in 2011 in its third season, however, she wasn't too pleased with how things were handled when it came to certain terminology the show used. Following her time on RPDR, Carrera came out as a trans woman and spoke out against RuPaul and the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which ‘RuPaul's Drag Race’ Queen Has The Highest Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>The star was referencing the use of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">offensive terms towards the trans community</a>, which Carmen claimed was "getting kind of old." RuPaul felt as if Carmen was attacking the show, despite all the good it did for the LGBTQ+ community. Considering the terminology was later changed to something more appropriate, it seems as if Carmen was definitely on to something.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bob-amp-peppermint><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Bob & Peppermint</span></h2><p>Bob and Peppermint are easily two of RPDR's most liked duo! The two both shined during their time on the series, so much that Bob The Drag Queen took home the win. Well, during an Instagram Live, the two revealed something that RuPaul definitely didn't want out.</p><p>When Peppermint asked Bob if she had seen a certain article about Ru, Bob assumed she was talking about RuPaul's hand in fracking.&nbsp;"Did you see that article from Instinct Magazine?" Peppermint asks Bob. "Oh, the fracking?" she replied. Peppermint was quick to keep hush on the matter, crossing her lips and falling into a laughing fit with Bob, a moment that has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">since turned into a meme.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=farrah-moan><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Farrah Moan</span></h2><p>Farrah Moan made her debut during the ninth season of RuPaul's Drag Race and later made her return for the 4th installment of All-Stars. During an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> with fellow RPDR judge, Carson Kressley, the queens were asked which of Ru's looks were most sickening this season.</p><p>Without skipping a beat, Farrah Moan chimed in with a read no one saw coming. "I mean, they're kinda always the same, aren't they?" Moan said in regards to Ru's attire. Her fellow co-stars and the audience couldn't contain their laughter, however, that was definitely a bold move for Farrah to come for RuPaul like that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=asia-o-hara><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Asia O'Hara</span></h2><p>Asia O'Hara and RuPaul had absolutely no beef during the filming of season 10, that is until the reunion! Asia was extremely vocal following The Vixen's exit from the stage, claiming that she and the rest of the queens should feel embarrassed for not having intervened or stopped her from walking out.</p><p>Asia <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">directed her anger towards Ru</a>, who also didn't do that grand a job at diffusing the situation. She went on to claim that it's clear The Vixen is going through something and that as drag queens and members of the LGBTQ+ community, they have a duty to stick up and stand with one another, and that didn't happen.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's How Much RuPaul Makes For ‘Drag Race'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibq5mXYr%2Bir8Rmqq2Zoqh6uLTOZp%2BarpVisLC5xGadqKpdp8KxrdSlZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdrag-race-stars-who-have-come-for-rupaul.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdrag-race-stars-who-have-come-for-rupaul.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdrag-race-stars-who-have-come-for-rupaul.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdrag-race-stars-who-have-come-for-rupaul.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdrag-race-stars-who-have-come-for-rupaul.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdrag-race-stars-who-have-come-for-rupaul.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gabe-bondoc-net-worth-2021-age-wikipedia-biography-height-family.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gabe-bondoc-net-worth-2021-age-wikipedia-biography-height-family.html>Gabe Bondoc Net Worth, Age, Wikipedia, Biography, Height, Family</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./andrew-tate-parents.html>The Role Of Andrew Tate Parents In His Kick Boxing Career</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./andrew-tate-parents.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
