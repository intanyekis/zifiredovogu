During that evening, Swift took home the Artist of the Decade Award, and she performed a brilliant medley of songs for her global audience.</p><p>"I guess what I’m trying to say is that all anyone in this room wants is to create something that will last, whatever it is in life, and the fact that this is an award that celebrates a decade of hard work and of art and of fun and memories—all that matters to me is the memories that I’ve had with you the fans over the years. you guys we’ve had fun, incredible, exhilarating times together, and may it continue," Swift said, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pitchfork</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interestingly, Eilish being caught enjoying the show also serves as a reminder that she was a Swift fan growing up.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Billie Eilish Didn't Recognize Orlando Bloom Meeting Him For The First Time, But Had The Best Reaction Afterwards</a></span></p><h2 id=billie-eilish-was-a-fan-of-taylor-swift-growing-up>Billie Eilish Was A Fan Of Taylor Swift Growing Up</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/billie-eilish-wearing-a-gucci-outfit.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When speaking with iHeart</a>, Billie touched on many topics, eventually revealing that her favorite song growing up was by none other than Taylor Swift.</p><p>"I used to love this song when I was, like, four — no, probably older than that. Probably, like, six. It's crazy. It's very country. When I listen to it now, I'm like, 'Wow, I totally didn't realize how country this was.' But I loved this song back then because I thought it was so bada--. I thought it was so cool and mean.

I didn't understand at all what a 'picture to burn' meant.

And of course he's nice to you. If you're in this room, you have something he needs," Swift said.</p><p>"The fact is that private equity is what enabled this man to think, according to his own social media posts, that he could 'buy me,'" Swift said. "But I'm obviously not going willingly," she said.</p><p>She went on to add, "Yet the most amazing thing to discover was that it would be the women in this industry who would have my back, and show me the most vocal support at one of the most difficult times. And I will never, ever forget it.
