Due to her father’s wealth, Shay’s family was very private when she was growing up, and they never went on vacation together to protect the wealth.</p><p>Edward Shay, Anna Shay’s father, died in 1995, and Ai Oizumi Shay, her mother, died in 2015. Shay didn’t talk about her family’s life in public until after they died. She did this to make up for the time she spent being private.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Anna Shay: Personal Life Details</strong></h2><p>People know that Shay’s family has ties to some of the worst parts of the Vietnam War. Research from the University of Dallas, Texas, was used by NBC to show that the CIA hired Anna’s father’s company, Pacific Architects and Engineers (PAE), in 1964 to build interrogation facilities in Vietnam.</p><p>Since Shay’s family life was very private and secretive, people are curious about how he got so rich. In 2006, Shay and her brother sold their dad’s business for about $1.2 billion.</p><p>Anna Shay has been married four times, and all of those marriages ended in divorce. But the star hasn’t said who her ex-husband is because she wants to protect his privacy. Kenny Kemp is the name of Shay’s son. The star has also had a facelift, Botox, and fillers, among other procedures.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Anna Shay: Career Details</strong></h2><p style=color:#252525>Shay is known for showing off her money, but she is also very kind. At an early morning flower market, she once helped a homeless man and bought him an apartment. Shay has done a lot of charity work in addition to making a lot of money in her work.</p><p style=color:#252525>Shay was on the board of the George Lopez Foundation for Kidney Disease and Organ Donation. Shay also worked for the foundation her late parents started, which was a programme for performing arts, education, the arts, and music.</p><p style=color:#252525>Aside from that, Shay is a reality TV star for the Netflix show Bling Empire. Jeff Jenkins, who used to be the producer of the popular reality show “Keeping Up with the Kardashians,” is the reason why the show is so popular. Shay told Jenkins that she wanted to work with him on The Show.</p><p style=color:#252525>Shay and her brother got their dad’s shares, which they sold and used to get rich. So, Shay is the most wealthy cast member of the TV show “Bling Empire.” The show “Bling Empire” is based on the real-life story “Crazy Rich Asians,” and Shay’s family story fits right in.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram">https://www.instagram.com/p/CZU6_d2o9hz/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</figure><h2><strong>How Does Anna Shay Spend Her Money?</strong></h2><p>Anna Shay Spends Her Money On Real Estate And Cars.</p><h3><strong>Anna Shay’s Home&nbsp;</strong></h3>Shay used to own an amazing mansion on one of the best plots along the famous Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood.

I didn’t do anything except being born. It’s my parents. My dad is from the South Side of Chicago. My mother is from the aristocracy. Those two are amazing. They’re not here, but they’re here. My mother said, ‘You were born in a crystal ball with a silver spoon.”&nbsp;</p><p>“To this day, I don’t understand the concept of this. How could somebody go up and say, ‘Can I sponsor this?’ It’s so embarrassing. I just walk away, like, I don’t know this person.”</p><p>“Very happy for everybody. Did I expect the show to be successful? No. I wasn’t even expecting to be in front of the camera. I’m very shy, and I went along with whatever situation was happening. It was just me. I think the success of the show has a lot to do with how Netflix.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Don’t think so. I have nothing against Christine. Met Christine nine, ten years ago while going to Fashion Week. I knew a different side of Christine then. During the show, however, she wanted to portray things — I just went with whatever she said.”</p><p>“Decided to have a party, and if anything, [the wrong time was] probably meant for me because I’m always late. I always say, when friends call me for dinner, ‘Don’t tell me the real-time!’”&nbsp;</p><p>“I believe that one creates their own style. It doesn’t matter if you’re wearing something from Target or Chanel. There’s only one thing that I wouldn’t wear. It’s something straight off of a mannequin because the mannequin is a size zero.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read more</strong> :</p><ul><li><a href=#>Bling Empire Season 3 Potential Return Date: Everything You Need To Know</a></li><li><a href=#>Net Worths Of The All Bling Empire Cast – Who Is The Richest Member Of Bling Empire?</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfo7K1edaoqa2gX5a7r62MrJ%2BasV2jsrV51qipraBfaIF1gZNo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fanna-shay-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fanna-shay-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fanna-shay-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fanna-shay-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fanna-shay-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fanna-shay-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./autumn-reeser.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./autumn-reeser.html>Autumn Reeser News - Us Weekly</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./why-jesus-ortiz-paz-fans-think-he-has-a-girlfriend-called-jailyne-ojeda-489132-html.html>Why Jesus Ortiz Paz Fans Think He Has A Girlfriend Called Jailyne Ojeda</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./why-jesus-ortiz-paz-fans-think-he-has-a-girlfriend-called-jailyne-ojeda-489132-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
