Jackson, Nina Blackwood, Martha Quinn, and Mark Goodman. However, over the years many VJs have come and gone from the network, some continued their careers in music, others branched into acting or continued hosting shows on other networks, and some just fell off the map completely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alan-hunter><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Alan Hunter</span></h2><p>Alan Hunter was one of the five original VJs.

Quinn was originally an actress and had done a few commercials before MTV. She then went on to have roles in shows like Full House and The Bradys and co-hosted Star Search, which was sort of the '90s version of America's Got Talent. She now hosts iHeartRadio's iHeartThe80s and a podcast called Talk Talk With Martha Quinn.</p><h2 id=mark-goodman><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Mark Goodman</span></h2><p>Goodman, like many of his fellow VJs, continued to work in music after leaving MTV in 1987.
