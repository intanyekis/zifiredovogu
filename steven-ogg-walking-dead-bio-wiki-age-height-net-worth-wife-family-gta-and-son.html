Produced by HBO, it is based on the 1973 film of the same name (written and directed by Michael Crichton) and, to a lesser extent, the film’s 1976 sequel Futureworld.</p><p>The story begins in Westworld, a fictional, technologically advanced Wild-West-themed amusement park populated by android “hosts”. The park caters to high-paying “guests” who may indulge their wildest fantasies within the park without fear of retaliation from the hosts, who are prevented by their programming from harming humans.</p><p>Later on, in the third season, the series’ plot expands to the real world, in the mid-21st century, where people’s lives are driven and controlled by a powerful artificial intelligence named Rehoboam.</p><p>Nolan and Joy serve as executive producers, along with J. J. Abrams, Jerry Weintraub, and Bryan Burk. The first season was broadcast between October 2 and December 4, 2016; it comprised ten episodes.</p><p>In November 2016, HBO renewed the series for a ten-episode second season, which was broadcast from April 22 to June 24, 2018. Westworld’s debut on HBO had the network’s highest viewership ratings for a premiere since the first episode of True Detective in 2014. Moreover, the series ranks as the most-watched first season of any HBO original series.</p><p>An eight-episode third season premiered on March 15, 2020, and concluded on May 3, 2020. In April 2020, HBO renewed the series for a fourth season.</p><p>Westworld was critically acclaimed during its first season, receiving praise for its performances, visuals, narrative, themes, and Ramin Djawadi’s musical score. The series continued to receive mostly positive reviews during its second and third seasons, though certain elements of its story and characterization have since come under criticism.</p><p>The series has received numerous accolades, winning 9 Primetime Emmy Awards out of 43 nominations. Thandie Newton won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2018.</p><h2 class="kno-ecr-pt PZPZlf gsmt i8lZMc" data-local-attribute=d3bn data-attrid=title data-ved=2ahUKEwiItIHFs_TpAhUdQhUIHQVoAbgQ3B0oATAfegQIGBAQ><span class=ez-toc-section id=steven-ogg-snowpiercer></span><span>Steven Ogg Snowpiercer</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Snowpiercer is a 2013 science fiction action film based on the French graphic novel Le Transperceneige by Jacques Lob, Benjamin Legrand, and Jean-Marc Rochette.</p><p>The film was directed by Bong Joon-ho and written by Bong and Kelly Masterson. A South Korean-Czech co-production, the film marks Bong’s English-language debut; almost 85% of the film’s dialogue is in English.</p><p>The film stars Chris Evans, Song Kang-ho, Tilda Swinton, Jamie Bell, Octavia Spencer, Go Ah-sung, John Hurt, and Ed Harris. It takes place aboard the Snowpiercer train as it travels a globe-spanning track, carrying the last remnants of humanity after a failed attempt at climate engineering to stop global warming has created a new Snowball Earth.</p><p>Evans stars as Curtis Everett, one of the lower-class tail-section passengers, as they rebel against the elite of the front of the train. Filming took place at Barrandov Studios in Prague, using train car sets mounted on gimbals to simulate the train’s motion.</p><p>Snowpiercer received critical acclaim and appeared on many film critics’ top ten lists of 2014 after its international release. Praise was primarily directed towards its vision, direction, and performances, particularly Evans’ and Swinton’s.</p><p>Initially planned for a limited-screen showing in the United States, the critical response prompted The Weinstein Company to expand the showing to more theaters and to digital streaming services. With a budget of $40 million, it remains the most expensive Korean production ever.</p><h2 class="kno-ecr-pt PZPZlf gsmt i8lZMc" data-local-attribute=d3bn data-attrid=title data-ved=2ahUKEwiItIHFs_TpAhUdQhUIHQVoAbgQ3B0oATAfegQIGBAQ><span class=ez-toc-section id=steven-ogg-law-and-order></span><span>Steven Ogg Law and Order</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Law & Order is an American police procedural and legal drama television series created by Dick Wolf, launching the Law & Order franchise. Airing its entire run on NBC, Law & Order premiered on September 13, 1990, and completed its twentieth and final season on May 24, 2010.</p><p>Set and filmed in New York City, the series follows a two-part approach: the first half-hour is the investigation of a crime (usually murder) and apprehension of a suspect by New York City Police Department detectives; the second half is the prosecution of the defendant by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. Plots are often based on real cases that recently made headlines, although the motivation for the crime and the perpetrator may be different.</p><p>The show has had a revolving cast over the years. Among the longest-running main cast members were Steven Hill as District Attorney Adam Schiff (seasons 1–10), Jerry Orbach as Detective Lennie Briscoe (seasons 3–14), S. Epatha Merkerson as Lieutenant Anita Van Buren (seasons 4–20), Sam Waterston as Executive Assistant District Attorney Jack McCoy (seasons 5–20; later District Attorney) and Jesse L. Martin as Detective Ed Green (seasons 10–18).</p><p>Law & Order’s twenty seasons are second only to its spin-off Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999–present) for the longest-running live-action scripted American primetime series.</p><p>The success of the series has led to the creation of additional shows, making Law & Order a franchise, with also a television film, several video games, and international adaptations of the series. It has won and has been nominated for numerous awards over the years, including a number of Emmy Awards.</p><p>On May 14, 2010, NBC announced that it had canceled Law & Order and would air its final episode on May 24, 2010. Immediately following the show’s cancellation, Wolf attempted to find a new home for the series. Those attempts failed, and in July 2010, Wolf declared that the series had now “moved to the history books”.</p><h2 class="kno-ecr-pt PZPZlf gsmt i8lZMc" data-local-attribute=d3bn data-attrid=title data-ved=2ahUKEwiItIHFs_TpAhUdQhUIHQVoAbgQ3B0oATAfegQIGBAQ><span class=ez-toc-section id=steven-ogg-broad-city></span><span>Steven Ogg Broad City</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Broad City is an American television sitcom created by and starring Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson. It was developed from their independent web series of the same name, which was produced between 2009 and 2011.</p><p>The sitcom, like the web series, is based on Glazer and Jacobson’s real-life friendship, and their attempt to “make it” in New York. The sitcom premiered on Comedy Central on January 22, 2014, and aired for five seasons, ending on March 28, 2019. The show received critical acclaim throughout its run and is considered one of the best television shows of the 2010s.</p><h2 class="kno-ecr-pt PZPZlf gsmt i8lZMc" style=text-align:center data-local-attribute=d3bn data-attrid=title data-ved=2ahUKEwiItIHFs_TpAhUdQhUIHQVoAbgQ3B0oATAfegQIGBAQ><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-steven-ogg></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Steven Ogg</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-steven-ogg></span><span>Who is Steven Ogg?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ogg is a well-known Canadian actor.
