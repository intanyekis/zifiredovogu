Thanks to those roles, Travolta almost certainly will continue to get acting work until he retires or passes away.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>John Travolta Lost Millions On This Controversial Movie, Nearly Ruining His Career</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thanks to the fact that Travolta has worked as a high-profile actor for decades now, he has managed to accumulate a huge fortune. Unlike Travolta's peers who have also cashed in, it turns out that he has a very different mindset when it comes to how he spends his money than other Hollywood heavyweights.</p><p><strong>Updated August 2023: </strong>John Travolta is not one of the Hollywood A-listers who spends his money on frivolous things. While his hobbies are expensive and the life that he is accustomed to costs money to maintain, Travolta is not one to risk his money when he does not know if there will be a return on his investment.</p><p>As a result of this, Travolta has amassed a net worth of $250 million.</p><p>The hesitancy to invest millions into a deal or a project could have to do with the fortune that Travolta lost with the film, 'Battlefield Earth'. As a result of that film, not only did Travolta's career not recover to the point of where it was before the movie was released, but he was never able to recoup that money either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As such, Travolta continues to spend his hard-earned money on his hobby of flying and living in lavish homes. There is no financial risk with doing so, and that is just the way Travolta likes it.</p><h2 id=how-does-john-travolta-spend-his-money>How Does John Travolta Spend His Money?</h2><p>After Saturday Night Fever was released in 1977, John Travolta became a huge star pretty much overnight. From there, Travolta went on to star in several more huge hits that ensured that the powers that be in Hollywood wanted to work with him.</p><p>Since Travolta has been in high demand off and on throughout his career, he has managed to demand some massive paydays. According to celebritynetworth.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Travolta has managed to accumulate a $250 million fortune</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/john-travolta-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like most people with that kind of money, Travolta has bought some truly incredible things.</p><p>One of the most obvious things that Travolta has spent his money on is real estate. According to reports, Travolta owns a $4 million home in Florida and an $18 million home in California, both of which he bought with his late wife Kelly Preston.</p><p>Of course, it shouldn't surprise anyone that Travolta has an extremely expensive car collection. However, unlike most stars who spend a huge portion of their travel budget on expensive cars, Travolta has found a different way to get around.</p><p>For many years now, Travolta has been a licensed pilot. In fact, according to reports, Travolta has owned at least one plane ever since 1976. In recent years it has been reported that Travolta owns an Eclope 500 and a former Qantas Boeing 707.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Did Kelly Preston React To John Travolta's Gay Affair Rumors Which Threatened The Legitimacy Of Their Marriage?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If that wasn't impressive enough, Travolta also owns his own airport which is located on the same property as his Florida home. On top of that, his Florida property also has an airstrip that allows him to take off directly from his home.</p><p>To maintain an aircraft is extremely expensive from all accounts, so it is hard to fathom how much it costs Travolta to own several.</p><p>On top of Travolta's homes, cars, and aircraft, he also owns things like luxury watches, a suit collection, and he goes on expensive vacations with his family.</p><h2 id=john-travolta-39-s-surprising-financial-philosophy>John Travolta's Surprising Financial Philosophy</h2><p>In 2017, a writer for entrepreneur.com named Amy Osmond Cook got the chance to talk to John Travolta. In the resulting interview, Osmond Cook got the chance to ask about a variety of topics including his lengthy career and philanthropic efforts.</p><p>Arguably the most interesting part of the aforementioned interview was when Travolta explained his views on spending his fortune.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/john-travolta.jpg><p>Given everything he owns, Travolta clearly leads an extremely lavish lifestyle.

"This is my own personal vulnerability, but it's also a strength in itself. I work hard for my money; I don't like to waste it, and I don't like to lose it."</p><p>Travolta went on to say, "I am not a very good example of clever business ventures. I am a good example of conservative ones, though. Something in my DNA will not let me take the risk. I am not a gambler type. I don't get the jaunt out of it."</p><p>"I know where every cent I've ever spent has gone. It's hard when you're not risking things, but that's the way I like it," Travolta concluded about his views on spending and risking his hard-earned money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKCeYsGzrdWoo62ZXaOytXnWqKmtoF2ovaa6w6KloGWkpLGixY4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjohn-travolta-net-worth-spending-today.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjohn-travolta-net-worth-spending-today.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjohn-travolta-net-worth-spending-today.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjohn-travolta-net-worth-spending-today.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjohn-travolta-net-worth-spending-today.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjohn-travolta-net-worth-spending-today.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./louis-tomlinson-claps-back-zayn-malik-song-good-years.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./louis-tomlinson-claps-back-zayn-malik-song-good-years.html>Louis Tomlinson Seemingly Fires Back After Fans Claim Zayns New Song Is About Him</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./gwen-stefani-wears-a-sexy-mesh-dress-photos-w161152.html>Gwen Stefani Wears a Sexy Mesh Dress: Photos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./gwen-stefani-wears-a-sexy-mesh-dress-photos-w161152.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
