The 33-year-old actress began her career starring in TV shows in her native Australia, but she became a worldwide sensation in 2013 when she starred in The Wolf of Wall Street. Since her breakout international role, Margot has been in a wide array of popular and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>critically acclaimed movies,</a> including playing&nbsp;<strong>Tonya Harding&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;I, Tonya, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Harley Quinn</a> in the&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Suicide Squad</a>&nbsp;films, and in 2023, as the titular character in&nbsp;<strong>Greta Gerwig</strong>‘s&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Barbie</a>. Her latest role has earned her a nomination for a 2024 Golden Globe Award in the Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy category.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/margot-robbie-husband-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Throughout Margot’s meteoric rise, one man has been by her side: her husband, <strong>Tom Ackerley, </strong>33. After meeting in 2013, the two struck up a love affair that has lasted until this day. Tom is more than Margot’s life partner: he’s worked with her on a handful of projects, helping to produce 2023’s Barbie, the aforementioned I, Tonya, and 2020’s Promising Young Woman, just to name a few. While Tom appeared alongside his wife for a June 2023<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Barbie photocall</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Most recently, the A-lister couple appeared alongside each other at the 33rd <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Annual Gotham Awards</a> on November 27, 2023. While at the event, Tom got cheeky with his leading lady and seemingly “pinched her bottom,” as reported by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a>. The sweet PDA moment happened on the red carpet alongside Greta and others, which naturally resulted in Margot bursting into laughter (see photo above).</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>With that said, get the scoop on their love, below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Margot-Robbie-Tom-Ackerley-splash-embed-1.jpg><h2>How Did Tom and Margot Meet?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Tom and Margot met right as she was becoming an international star! The English native was a third assistant to the director for the 2014 film Suite Française,&nbsp;which came out right after&nbsp;Wolf Of Wall Street, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>. Margot revealed that the cast and crew became very close during the filming in a 2018 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Guardian</a>. So close that they all decided to move in together! “We were like: ‘Wouldn’t it be funny if we all lived together?’ Someone said: ‘But you don’t live in London,’ and I said: ‘I don’t live&nbsp;anywhere. I’ll move.’ Three days later we signed a lease in Clapham,” she said. During the time they were living together (with five others in the house), they started their romance, and they got married in December 2016.</p><h2>Tom Worked in the Entertainment Industry for Years Before Marrying Margot</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>While Tom has become a collaborator for a number of Margot’s projects, Tom has worn a bunch of different hats in showbiz over the years. He became a runner on a number of different projects as early as 2011. He worked on films like&nbsp;War Horse&nbsp;and&nbsp;Rush,&nbsp;before getting assistant directing positions for projects like the&nbsp;<strong>Sacha Baron Cohen&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Rebel Wilson-</strong>starring comedy&nbsp;The Brother’s Grimsby&nbsp;in 2016 or, of course, Suite Française.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Margot-Robbie-Tom-Ackerley-shutter-embed-3.jpg><h2>He’s Been a Producer for Many of His Wife’s Projects</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>After Tom and Margot tied the knot, he started taking on bigger roles within her various productions. After they got married in 2016, he was a producer on her hit biopic&nbsp;I, Tonya in 2017, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>. &nbsp;He’s also produced other pictures with his wife as a star, including 2018’s&nbsp;Terminal and 2019’s Dreamland. He’s a producer on a bunch of her projects,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> including&nbsp;</a><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Barbie</a>&nbsp;and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>an&nbsp;Ocean’s 11&nbsp;film</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Other than collaborations with his wife, Tom has also been a producer for critically-acclaimed pictures, like&nbsp;Promising Young Woman&nbsp;or the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2023 Boston Strangler&nbsp;film</a>.</p><h2>What Has Margot Said About Tom?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Margot-Robbie-and-Tom-Ackerley-barbie-premiere-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>While Margot and Tom have been married for about six years, they’ve mostly kept their relationship to themselves. The&nbsp;Once Upon a Time In Hollywood&nbsp;star revealed that the pair’s roommates pressed them to move out on their own in the previously mentioned Guardian&nbsp;interview. She’s also joked about her love of all things England including her husband in a 2021 chat with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>DailyMail</a>. “I seem to love a lot of British things. I love Harry Potter, I love my husband, and I love Love Island. It’s great,” she said. In the same interview, she also spoke about how grateful they are to get to work together on a number of projects. “We started our production company with our best friends, and it continues to be a wonderful group dynamic. We all really work well together. I feel very lucky,” she explained.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Despite being a pro, Margot has said she gets nervous before working on every movie, and she’s said that her husband helps her chill before working in an August 2021 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mirror</a>. “Every time I do a movie, I turn to my husband and I’m like, ‘I don’t think I can do this’. He says something like, ‘You do this every time. You’ll be fine,'” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>While the pair are mostly private, Margot has revealed that the couple have two rescue dogs&nbsp;<strong>Belle&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Boo Radley&nbsp;</strong>in a 2019 interview on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ellen</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Margot-Robbie-Tom-Ackerley-shutter-embed-2.jpg><h2>Future Plans</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Given that the pair are notoriously private, they’ve kept so many details about their relationship under wraps, including if and when they plan to have kids. Margot has also revealed that the baby question is the one that she’s the most annoyed with in a 2019 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Radio Times.</a> “I got married, and the first question in almost every interview is, ‘Babies? When are you having one?’ I’m so angry that there’s this social contract,” she said at the time. “You’re married, now have a baby. Don’t presume. I’ll do what I’m going to do.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8yaqaCnpGK%2FsK7BopxmoKWor6K6w2ZrcG9oZoBxew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmargot-robbie-husband-4778130.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmargot-robbie-husband-4778130.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmargot-robbie-husband-4778130.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmargot-robbie-husband-4778130.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmargot-robbie-husband-4778130.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmargot-robbie-husband-4778130.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gian-luca-passi-de-preposulo.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gian-luca-passi-de-preposulo.html>Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./eric-berry-net-worth.html>Eric Berry Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./eric-berry-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
