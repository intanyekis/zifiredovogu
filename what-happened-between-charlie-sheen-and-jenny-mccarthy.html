Perceptions started to change, and in fact, the likes of <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan shied away from certain scenes with the actor.</a>Another name who took exception to their work together, was none other than Jenny McCarthy. Although the two enjoyed great chemistry on Two and a Half Men, McCarthy looked back at her time on the show with worry.Let's take a look back at what the two stars had to say about each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=charlie-sheen-had-a-positive-relationship-with-most-of-his-female-co-stars-on-two-and-a-half-men>Charlie Sheen Had A Positive Relationship With Most Of His Female Co-Stars On Two And A Half Men</h2><p>Although Charlie Sheen spiraled out of Two and a Half Men, behind the scenes, according to his co-stars, there was absolutely no foul play. <a href=#>Holland Taylor was among the co-stars to publicly defend Sheen</a>, mentioning that their relationship was nothing but positive, despite the opposite holding true on camera.</p><p>"Charlie was cordial and polite with all of his cast mates and crew, sometimes even courtly -- and always witty," Holland stated.</p><p>"We watched movies at his house occasionally -- warm evenings with interesting, spirited conversation. This is the guy I know. In this very sad and complicated time I really have no comment beyond valuing my own history with Charlie, and my abiding affection for him."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Charlie Sheen's Rejected Idea For His Return To Two And A Half Men Might've Been Better Than Chuck Lorre's Offer</a></span></p><p>Another love interest of his on the show, <a href=#>Jennifer Taylor would agree with Holland's comments</a>, stating that their relationship was a positive one off-camera.</p><p>"He was a normal, fun, nice guy. When I was on it, the day-to-day experience was wonderful," she told Fox News Digital.</p><p>She continued, "I got along with Charlie really, really well. He did his job. He's very good at it. I also kind of had blinders on a little bit because I had two small children. I was finishing my bachelor's degree at the same time. I came to work, and I came home."</p><p>Despite their chemistry on-screen, Jenny McCarthy would take a different approach, and one that wasn't a popular opinion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jenny-mccarthy-showed-major-concern-having-worked-with-charlie-sheen-on-two-and-a-half-men-following-the-reveal-of-a-certain-diagnosis>Jenny McCarthy Showed Major Concern Having Worked With Charlie Sheen On Two And A Half Men, Following The Reveal Of A Certain Diagnosis</h2><p>Charlie Sheen made a major announcement years back, stating that he was HIV positive. While some of his peers decided to show support, <a href=#>Jenny McCarthy had a different agenda</a>. The actress worried about their time together on Two and a Half Men, which would also feature kissing scenes.</p><p>"Playing even his love interest on the show, back in the day, I go, 'Ick! That's not fair. It's scary.' I have sympathy for him because, you know, he's sick and it's awful, but man, he's going to have to take some major accountability with many people in his life," she said.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The Real Way Chuck Lorre Was Able To Get Angus T.

Sheen in particular, wasn't impressed with Jenny's 'math skills'. According to Sheen, <a href=#>McCarthy had the timeline completely wrong</a>, as he was positive well after Two and a Half Men.</p><p>"If she's listening, Jenny, you're an absolute rock star and a doll, but my gosh," Charlie stated.</p><p>"Jenny McCarthy should go back and murder her math teacher. Why? Because her simple math skills are s**t."</p><p>Sheen continues, "When I came out, she's like, 'I kissed him, I touched him. Your math sucks.
