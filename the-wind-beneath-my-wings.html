The song opens with the acknowledgment that the person in question may have been in the shadows, never receiving any attention, and may have even felt cold there. But despite all this, they were always happy to support the singer and help them shine. The singer realizes that they were the one with all the acclaim but that it was the other person who had all the strength. The other person has a beautiful face and a beautiful smile, but they have always been without a name. They have been hiding their pain behind their smile.</p><br><p>As the song progresses, the singer confesses that they could never have achieved anything without the support of the other person. They are everything the singer wishes to be, and they are the wind beneath the singer's wings. They have allowed the singer to soar higher than an eagle. Although it may have seemed like the singer achieved everything alone, they know that they could never have done it without the other person.</p><br><p>This song is a beautiful tribute to the unsung heroes in our lives. Often, there are people in our lives who are always there to support us, but we don't acknowledge them enough. The song reminds us of the importance of these people and their role in our success. We should take the time to thank them and appreciate their contribution to our lives.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines
