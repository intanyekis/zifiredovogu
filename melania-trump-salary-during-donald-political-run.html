They use this money to support political activities on their own.</p><p>The particular group in question is known as Make America Great Again, the same mantra that Trump used to drive his successful quest for the highest office in the land in 2016. The news was first made public by The New York Times, in a report that claimed that the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">payments to Melania</a> had been made in December 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The NYT bombshell was published in July 2023, about one and a half years later.

This was triggered when Trump filed new disclosure forms in 2023. In the documents, the payments were described as having been for a “speaking engagement.” The timing of the transfer, aligning with the date of a fundraiser for his campaign, was also deemed suspicious.</p><h2 id=melania-trump-did-not-face-legal-consequences-for-the-politically-affiliated-payment>Melania Trump Did Not Face Legal Consequences For The Politically-Affiliated Payment</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/instar50441225-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The reports about a Trump-affiliated Super PAC making out a payment to Melania Trump emerged midway through 2023.

One notable <a href=#>absentee throughout all these court visits was Melania Trump</a>. It was not lost on the public as well as the press, with questions looming over the potential reasons for her no-show.</p><p>Melania not showing up for her husband’s court dates did not help whispers of a potential fallout between the former first couple. Rumors of a possible divorce have always frequented social media, with some even going as far as trying to estimate <a href=#>how much she would make in the event of one</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Donald has always been famous for enforcing prenup agreements with the women he ended up marrying, although Melania proved her smarts while he was President, and seeking re-election for a second term.
