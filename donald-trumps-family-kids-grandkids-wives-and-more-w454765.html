Former president <a href=#><strong>Donald Trump</strong></a> has a large family tree, with numerous siblings, wives, children and grandchildren.</p><p>The real estate mogul was born to the late Fred and Mary Trump on June 14, 1946 in Queens, New York City. His father was born in the Bronx to German immigrants while his mother immigrated to America from Scotland in 1930. Donald was the fourth of five children: <strong>Maryanne Trump Barry</strong>, Fred Jr., who died at age 42, <strong>Elizabeth Trump Grau</strong>&nbsp;and a younger brother, Robert, who died at age 71. Like his fourth son, Fred Sr. was a real estate mogul prior to his June 1999 death at age 93.</p><p>The <a href=#>45th POTUS</a> wasn’t the only Trump family member who forayed into politics. His eldest sister, Maryanne, was a senior judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit before her retirement in February 2019. President <a href=#><strong>Bill Clinton</strong> </a>nominated Maryanne, a Republican, in June 1999. Five years later, Supreme Court Justice <strong>Sandra Day O’Connor</strong> presented the judge with a Seton Hall University School of Law award given to women who excel in public service.</p><p>The former Apprentice star also has a big family of his own. He first married the Czech-American model Ivana&nbsp;Zelníčková in April 1977 and they welcomed three children, <a href=#><strong>Donald Jr.</strong></a> (born 1977), <a href=#><strong>Ivanka</strong></a> (born 1981) and <strong>Eric</strong> (born 1984).&nbsp;Before the couple’s 1992 divorce, the former model became a fixture in NYC’s social scene and worked as an interior design consultant for her husband’s company. She later married <strong>Riccardo Mazzucchelli</strong> and <strong>Rossano Rubicondi</strong>, but both of those unions also ended in divorce. Ivana <a href=#>passed away at age 73</a> in July 2022.</p><p>All three of Donald’s children played major roles in <a href=#>his 2016 presidential campaign</a> and serve as executive vice presidents at the Trump Organization, a&nbsp; New York–based conglomerate of the former reality star’s many business ventures. All three children also previously served as advisers and boardroom judges on <a href=#>The Apprentice</a>. When the New York native announced in November 2022 that he is entering the 2024 presidential race, Ivanka revealed that she wouldn’t be involved with the campaign.</p><p>“I love my father very much. This time around, I am choosing to prioritize my young children and the <a href=#>private life we are creating as a famil</a>y. I do not plan to be involved in politics,” the University of Pennsylvania alum told <a href=# rel=noopener>Fox News</a>.</p><p>Donald’s second wife was actress and model <a href=#><strong>Marla Maples</strong></a>, with whom he had an affair while he was still married to Ivana. In October 1993, two months before they tied the knot at the Plaza Hotel in New York, the couple welcomed daughter <a href=#><strong>Tiffany</strong></a>. Maples and Donald split in 1997 and divorced in 1999. Maples reemerged in the spotlight in 2016 as she competed on season 22 of Dancing With the Stars with partner Tony Dovolani before finishing in 10th place.</p><p>Following his divorce in 1999, the Art of the Deal author married <a href=#><strong>Melania</strong></a> (née Knavs) at a star-studded wedding ceremony in Palm Beach in January 2005. Born in Slovenia, the former model moved to New York in 1996 and became a U.S. citizen in 2006, the same year she and Donald welcomed their son, Barron.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Donald had 10 grandchildren total. Donald Jr. shares five kids with his ex-wife <strong>Vanessa</strong>, Ivanka has three with her businessman husband <a href=#><strong>Jared Kushner</strong></a>, and Eric and wife <strong>Lara</strong> share two children.</p><p>Scroll down to find out more about Donald Trump’s extended family:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNksbC6wKWbZqyiqrqxv4yfmKahnK56rLXDrGSgqpGjsay1w6xksKGmmsBurc2dZKanopp6uICUbW5vbV8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdonald-trumps-family-kids-grandkids-wives-and-more-w454765.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdonald-trumps-family-kids-grandkids-wives-and-more-w454765.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdonald-trumps-family-kids-grandkids-wives-and-more-w454765.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdonald-trumps-family-kids-grandkids-wives-and-more-w454765.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdonald-trumps-family-kids-grandkids-wives-and-more-w454765.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdonald-trumps-family-kids-grandkids-wives-and-more-w454765.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sheila-hafsadi.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sheila-hafsadi.html>Meet Sheila Hafsadi- Meet Wife of the Twilight Saga actor, Jackson Rathbone</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sonita-henry-net-worth.html>Sonita Henry Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sonita-henry-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
