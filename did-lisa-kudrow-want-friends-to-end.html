As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa Kudrow</a> stated, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it was the connection between the characters that made the show so relatable</a>, "Part of what appeals about ['Friends'] now is that young people have this unconscious nostalgia for personal connection. And not just right now during the pandemic, but before that," Kudrow said in the Times interview. "I don't see a reality where 'Friends' was anything but good," she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although nobody wanted to say goodbye, the show ended after ten seasons. In truth, it could've went on and on, continuing to bring in stellar numbers. Behind the scenes, a lot of the cast struggled with the finale, most notably <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston</a>. On the flip side, everyone ultimately enjoyed their own type of success once the show came to an end.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Lisa Kudrow Is The Smartest 'Friends' Cast Member</a></span></p><p>Interstingly enough, everyone had their own interpretations of the show coming to an end.

I would keep going. There would come a time anyway when someone would have said, ‘We’ve had enough.’ But why not have fun until they do?&nbsp;It was just really fun. But I think we were extremely appreciative at the time. It’s not like we did not appreciate how fun it was and how good the writing was. We were all very proud and appreciative.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why Lisa Kudrow Was Fired From ‘Frasier’… And How She Got ‘Friends’ The Same Year</a></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/867607-lisakudrow-mattleblanc-friends.jpeg><p>She had a change of heart later, stating that it was right to end the show. Like a lot of the others, Kudrow admits she would've never been able to pull the plug herself on the series and she's glad someone else did when they did, "I was fine with doing more [seasons]. Now I’m happy that we didn’t,” says Kudrow. “Only because, when would I have left? You really would have had to kick me out.

One, she's scared she won't like her perforemncce on the show, which most fans know is an impossibility. Secondly, she wants to wait and watch the show alongside her fellow co-stars one day, maybe after quarantine, "'I don’t watch the show. I’m still not watching it in the hopes that one day we sit down and watch them together,' Kudrow said.</p><p>Fans would definitely be into that. For the time being, fans are eager for the reunion to take place, one that was pushed back because of the pandemic.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston And Lisa Kudrow Admit Watching 'Friends' Bloopers For Hours</a></span></p><p>Sources: Daily Mail, Cheat Sheet & Insider</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoba0rYykrJ2qn6x6uK3NrWSfqpmau6W%2FjK2mZp2emXw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-lisa-kudrow-want-friends-to-end.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-lisa-kudrow-want-friends-to-end.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-lisa-kudrow-want-friends-to-end.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-lisa-kudrow-want-friends-to-end.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-lisa-kudrow-want-friends-to-end.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-lisa-kudrow-want-friends-to-end.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dougray-scott.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dougray-scott.html>Dougray Scott</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./cherylene-chan-arshvir-kaur-bajwa-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-338371-html.html>Cherylene Chan Arshvir Kaur Bajwa Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagra</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./cherylene-chan-arshvir-kaur-bajwa-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-338371-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
