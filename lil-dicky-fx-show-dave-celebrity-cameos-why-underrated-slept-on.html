<time>23 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Since its premier on FX in March 2020, Dave has had its share amount of fans, but its become one of those beloved shows that is largely slept on. It became FX's biggest comedy show in their history, but it still seems like it hasn't reached its full potential.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, while the show many not be for everyone (the critics are divided), it seems like celebrities love both the man behind the camera and the show, often popping up in episodes for a quick cameo or stay on as recurring characters.The latest season, season three, started back in April 2023, and ramped up the celebrity appearances, with big names no one ever thought would appear, especially on a show like Dave.</p><p>So what is Dave about, and why is it slept on? What makes mega stars like Brad Pitt want to join its wild ride?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Little Known Facts About Dave Burd, The Man Behind Lil Dicky</a></span></p><h2 id=exploring-lil-dicky-amp-dave>Exploring Lil Dicky & Dave</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/depositphotos_348891666_xl.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lil Dicky may not be a household name, but<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the rapper's been cranking out hit tunes since 2013 </a>and started his track record with working with big celebrities in his music. His "government name" is David Burd, but as his rap persona Lil Dicky he largely focuses on comedy rap, talking about everyday life or awkward, yet relatable occurrences he's had.</p><p>His music videos on YouTube and his 2015 debut album, Professional Rapper, quickly shot him up to stardom in the industry. With his debut, his connections were already evident and that many celebs had faith in him as musicians like Snoop Dogg, Brendon Urie from Panic! At the Disco, Fetty Wap, and T-Pain featured on his album.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before becoming a rapper, Lil Dicky had always wanted to become a writer for movies and tv shows, but then he fell in love with rap. His show Dave allowed him to explore both passions. Lil Dicky joined with producer Jeff Schaffer to co-create it, as well as Kevin Hart and Greg Mottola, to bring to life a fictionalized series of his life, particularly exploring the world of rap and the music industry. Lil Dicky not only co-created the show, but he's one of the composers, an executive producer, and a writer for it.</p><p>Dave features characters either inspired by people in his life or playing themselves like his hype man, GaTa - whose also a rapper. The show isn't afraid to explore uncomfortable scenarios with often raunchy comedic scenes and plots, but it also doesn't shy away from important discussions like mental health, the obsession with fame, and self-love. It's often been compared to the other FX series, Atlanta, which also explores the music industry.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Lil Dicky's Rise To Fame, Explained</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-lil-dicky-39-s-fx-show-dave-featured-these-massive-stars>How Lil Dicky's FX Show, Dave, Featured These Massive Stars</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/depositphotos_110066204_xl.jpg><p>How exactly does Lil Dicky get so many high profile celebrities on Dave? Well, again, it started with Lil Dicky's music career. <a href=#>One of Lil Dicky's biggest hits, "Earth",</a> which centered around protecting the environment and the looming threat of global warming, was released in 2019 and featured over thirty artists including Leonardo DiCaprio (who is famously known for his conservation work). It also helps that Lil Dicky has worked and been managed by industry giants like Scooter Braun Benny Blanco.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But the main reason seems to be that most people just genuinely love working with Lil Dicky and are more than happy to collaborate with him, whether its through music or television. In multiple interviews, Lil Dicky has stated that he gets most of the people on his show because they love his work and have enjoyed the show as viewers. Over its three seasons, Dave has featured an impressive lineup of musicians and actors like Jack Harlowe, Macklemore, Usher, Demi Lovato, Doja Cat, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and a recurring role by Benny Blanco.</p><h2 id=the-big-celebrity-cameos-on-season-3-of-dave>The Big Celebrity Cameos On Season 3 Of Dave</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/3-16.jpg><p>Many of the celebrities mentioned above appeared in Dave season three, but it wasn't until episode eight, "Met Gala", that the show featured its biggest stars yet and continued doing so until the finale. "Met Gala" saw Dave attending a fictionalized Met Gala for the first time and the episode was jammed pack with notable celebs, including Anna Wintour herself. A bathroom selfie plot line included cameos by David Dobrik, Finneas, Machine Gun Kelly and Megan Fox, Travis Barker, Jack Harlow, Emma Chamberlain, Don Cheadle, and Rachel McAdams - who played a major role in the episode and appeared in the next two as a love interest for Dave.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many didn't think the show could top this episode or the infamous moment in the bathroom, but<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Dave's season three finale "Looking for Love</a>" blew everything out of the water. It started with a music video exploring a relationship between Dave and Rachel McAdams with the camera then cutting to a quick shot of Brad Pitt as a potential rival.</p><p>At first, the audience thinks that's the end of his appearance, but he goes on to show up in the rest of the episode when he goes to Dave's house to start a music career and the two are violently threatened into staying at the house and interacting with a psychotic fan who wants to help make music, hang out, and make ceramics with mounds of cement she has ordered.</p><p>To top it off, at the end of the episode, Dave finally meets his idol, Drake, who shows up and is a perfect encapsulation of the idea that Dave still can't choose happiness and love over fame - a major theme that occurs throughout the entire show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> Would Rachel McAdams Ever Work With Ryan Gosling Again?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-makes-stars-want-to-cameo-on-lil-dicky-39-s-series-dave>What Makes Stars Want To Cameo On Lil Dicky's Series, Dave</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/depositphotos_428379790_xl.jpg><p>The guests Lil Dicky gets on Dave love the series and has made it surprisingly easy for him to get them on board for both standalone episodes and recurring plot lines. Drake found the show to have cultural significance and admired Lil Dicky and the series, which is the usual interaction Dave has with guest stars on the show. Brad Pitt was also a fan of the show, which prompted Lil Dicky to reach out through email to ask if he'd appear in an episode of Dave - similarly with Rachel McAdams.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But Lil DIcky doesn't acquire guest stars just to brag about the celebs who will star on Dave, he's said there's a purpose behind each one of them, in which they represent a theme an episode is tackling or an aspect of his life that needs to be explored, such as using Rachel McAdams as a love interest, Drake as his idol and representation of fame, or Brad Pitt as a guiding voice for the celebrity world. He knew it could be hard securing these celebs, but it has largely worked out in his favor over the course of the series.</p><p>And while watching some of our favorite celebrities pop up in episodes is a treat, Dave is much more than a vehicle for comedy at the expense of icons like Brad Pitt, Doja Cat, and Macklemore.</p><p><a href=#>Dave provides a vehicle for Lil Dicky to let viewers into a world of fame and luxury </a>as well as the darkness and loneliness that can come from it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's both hilarious and haunting, with the center being on a man whose insecurities and desire for recognition and fame is his downfall. There's even an episode where he fakes his own death, proving there's no bridge he won't cross when it comes to becoming a star - or in his case,"the biggest rapper in the world". Dave is truly one of the most underrated and overlooked gems on television right now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijoqRdmbakt9hmnbFlo528uHnDmq2eZZOauaau0aKrsmWTlrqmu9JmrqGxXaq7pbHRq5itnZRiwK2xz61kqKZf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flil-dicky-fx-show-dave-celebrity-cameos-why-underrated-slept-on.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flil-dicky-fx-show-dave-celebrity-cameos-why-underrated-slept-on.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flil-dicky-fx-show-dave-celebrity-cameos-why-underrated-slept-on.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flil-dicky-fx-show-dave-celebrity-cameos-why-underrated-slept-on.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flil-dicky-fx-show-dave-celebrity-cameos-why-underrated-slept-on.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flil-dicky-fx-show-dave-celebrity-cameos-why-underrated-slept-on.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./catherine-mcbroom-wiki-net-worth-husband-marriage-height.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./catherine-mcbroom-wiki-net-worth-husband-marriage-height.html>Catherine Mcbroom- Wiki, Net Worth, Husband, Marriage, Height</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./billie-eilish-ex-boyfriend-jesse-rutherford-pov-lyrics-about-controversial-relationship.html>What Jesse Rutherford's 'POV' Lyrics May Reveal About Billie Eilish And Their Controversial Relation</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./billie-eilish-ex-boyfriend-jesse-rutherford-pov-lyrics-about-controversial-relationship.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
