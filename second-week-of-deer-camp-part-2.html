The song paints a picture of the typical activities that occur in the camp and the comic mishaps that ensue.</p><br><p>The song begins with a gunshot that turns out to have killed a cow instead of a deer, leading to chaos and an upset owner. The singer then describes the state of his hangover from the copious amounts of beer consumed during the week. He is incapacitated, lying on the floor with dust bunnies and his pants frozen to the ground.</p><br><p>The second verse describes the other members of the camp, including a card cheat, a snoring thief who stole someone's boots and sleeping with a gun, and someone's dirty underwear hanging on the pump. Later, another hunter appears with frostbite, and another claims he hit a deer with his truck.</p><br><p>Overall, the song satirizes the typical deer camp experience, where more drinking, playing cards, and general debauchery occur than actual hunting. It celebrates the camaraderie and memories shared during this time of year.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Hey there goes one (BANG!)
