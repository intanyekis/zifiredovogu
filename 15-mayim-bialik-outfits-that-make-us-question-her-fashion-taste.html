She starred as a teenager on NBC’s sitcom,&nbsp;Blossom, as the titular character. The show ran from 1991 to 1995, and after it ended, Mayim put her acting career on hold to focus on her studies at UCLA, earning a Ph.D. in neuroscience. She returned to acting in 2005, and in 2010, she landed the role of Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler on the long-running CBS sitcom,&nbsp;The Big Bang Theory. The character is also a neuroscientist, and Mayim even checks her lines to make sure that they’re scientifically accurate. Her character has become one of the most popular and beloved characters on the show and is in a relationship with the equally-beloved main character, Sheldon Cooper. Mayim has also received critical acclaim for her portrayal of Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One thing that Mayim hasn’t received much praise for is her fashion sense. While it’s understandable that she has to wear some dodgy outfits as her character on The Big Bang Theory, it seems that we have a case of life imitating art as she’s been seen in many questionable outfits. Let’s take a look at some of the worst ones!</p><h2 id=downton-abbey-tribute>Downton Abbey Tribute</h2><p>Retro-inspired outfits can be really gorgeous, but not if you choose one of the frumpier styles from the previous decades! Mayim chose this outdated and frumpy, black gown to attend the Screen Actors Guild Awards ceremony in 2016. To be honest, it looks as if she decided to pay tribute to the TV show Downton Abbey, which was one of the biggest winners of that night. But instead of going for one of the pretty outfits worn by the characters closer in age to her, it looks as if Mayim was inspired by the Dowager Countess who was played by Maggie Smith! Nothing works— the gown’s style is frumpy, the yellow embroidery on the neckline and sleeves is old-fashioned, and her makeup doesn’t suit her due to the makeup artist clearly going overboard with the bronzer!</p><h2 id=black-frumpiness>Black Frumpiness</h2><p>On March 20, 2013, Mayim attended the 21st Annual "A Night At Sardi’s" Gala to Benefit the Alzheimer’s Association, which was held at the Beverly Hills Hotel. She’s one of those celebrities who give back to the community, so she’s often seen at such charity events. The thing is, you don’t need to dress for those charity events as if you bought your outfit at a charity shop! This all-black outfit is just sad and one can’t help but compare Mayim to a widow in mourning! It’s a shame because Mayim has worn some gorgeous all-black outfits in the past, so it’s not as if she can’t pull them off. The blazer’s bad enough on its own but paired with the frumpy dress and even frumpier shoes, it’s all just a big no-no.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=champagne-awkwardness>Champagne Awkwardness</h2><p>Mayim attended PaleyFest in 2016. PaleyFest is an annual television festival that is hosted by the Paley Center for Media in Los Angeles. It is also known as the William S. Paley Television Festival. It is attended by cast members and creators of popular television shows. Naturally, Mayim attended along with her cast members from The Big Bang Theory. She chose a dress with an ivory-colored top and a champagne-colored skirt, and it isn’t a very nice dress. It’s shapeless and is therefore very unflattering, and the colors wash her out a bit. It was also a mistake to pair it with a black fake leather jacket, especially one that seems to be made out of poor quality fake leather. Well, at least the sandals and her hair are cute!</p><h2 id=1970-s-mother-of-the-bride>1970's Mother Of The Bride</h2><p>In 2013,&nbsp;Mayim Bialik was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for her portrayal of Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler on The Big Bang Theory. This was a very important night for her, and it’s normal for the focus to be on the nominees on the red carpet, especially when it comes to their outfits. Everyone wants to look their best during an important night, right? Mayim decided to go for a green gown, and while the shade suits her perfectly, and the sweetheart neckline is also really pretty, the rest of the gown is more frumpy than glamorous. The foliage around the shoulders, elbows, and waist is just way over-the-top and makes her look less like a red-carpet beauty and more like a mother of the bride from the 1970's!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=electric-blue-fail>Electric Blue Fail</h2><p>Mayim has become a critical darling, thanks to her role on The Big Bang Theory. She’s received multiple nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, and 2014 was no exception. She’d already been criticized for the outfit that she wore to the 2013 Emmy Awards ceremony, so some had hoped that she’d turn up in a better outfit, but her choice for 2014 wasn’t much of an improvement. Once again, she went for a color that suited her, this time a stunning shade of electric blue, but the actual style of the dress was where it all went wrong. When wearing such a bold color, it’s sometimes better to choose a simpler style, whereas this huge lace gown is just a bit too much for our liking!</p><h2 id=striped-disaster>Striped Disaster</h2><p>In 2017, Mayim attended the Screen Actors Guild Awards ceremony. She wasn’t nominated for any awards, but as an actress who is part of the cast of one of the most popular and successful sitcoms on the air, it’s normal for her to attend award ceremonies, and she’s more than happy to do so. For this awards ceremony, she chose a striped gown, and while the style of the gown was actually amazing and her hair, makeup, and jewelry were all perfect, the striped pattern of the gown was just awful-looking. Striped gowns can be really pretty, but this pattern would be far better suited to be made into curtains instead of being made into a red carpet gown! So while the general idea of the outfit was good, unfortunately, the pattern choice was completely wrong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lilac-and-lace-mishap>Lilac And Lace Mishap</h2><p>Oh dear, what is going on with this outfit? Mayim was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award in 2014, and it looks as if she chose her outfit for the awards ceremony by asking herself: ‘’What would Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler wear?’’ Seriously, this dress seems like the kind of weirdly-mismatched and frumpy thing that Amy would proudly wear! The lilac gown has a black, lace see-through top sounds nice, but you can see that the lace pattern is a bit on the busy side, so it just looks ridiculous. The skirt’s asymmetrical hemline is poorly-executed, and we also get a flash of its black underlining and her frumpy black flat shoes. It could have been a cute dress, but everything has just been put together so badly!</p><h2 id=red-snooze-fest>Red Snooze-Fest</h2><p>If we’re going to be completely honest, this outfit isn’t as major a fashion faux-pas as some other outfits on this list. So why has it been included? Well, it’s an outfit that is way too boring for a major red carpet event and would instead look better if worn to an ordinary office work party. Mayim opted for this snooze-fest of an outfit for the 2017 People’s Choice Awards ceremony. While the shade of red suits her and the grey heels go great with that shade of red, the three-quarter length of the dress is what makes it boring and a bit on the frumpy side. If it had been shorter or floor-length, it would be a pretty good outfit, especially since the lace pattern is really nice, as well as her hair and makeup!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=awkward-fit>Awkward Fit</h2><p>It’s actually a shame that we have to include this dress on our list— the dress is actually really nice, but the problem is that it’s so ill-fitting that Mayim just looks really awkward in it! They could have easily made it for her in a smaller size because then it would have fitted her perfectly and she would have looked gorgeous in it! Because let’s face it, a dress consisting of a black long-sleeved top and a silver skirt is a great idea and it could have and should have worked! It makes you question Mayim’s dress sense because most women would opt for a dress in a size that fits them well. This dress was worn by Mayim to the 2015 People’s Choice Awards ceremony, which she attended with her TBBT co-stars, Kaley Cuoco and Melissa Rauch.</p><h2 id=red-matronly-gown>Red Matronly Gown</h2><p>2012 was a big year for Mayim, as it was the first time that she was nominated for an Emmy for her role as Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler on The Big Bang Theory. She blogged about struggling to find the right dress to wear to the awards ceremony due to her not being the typical super-slim Hollywood actress, revealing that fortunately, the search had come to an end and she’d chosen a bright red gown by Pamella Roland. Now, wearing bright red on the red carpet might not seem like the best idea as it won’t stand out as much, but her readers had faith in her, and it would have worked with the right style of dress. However, Mayim’s gown of choice was a bit too matronly, and the sleeves were a bit gauze-like.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zebra-faux-pas>Zebra Faux-Pas</h2><p>This outfit is probably one of Mayim’s worst ones so far. Nothing would work separately and none of it certainly works when put together! The cardigan’s too boring and blah for any kind of red carpet event. The black and white zebra-inspired dress looks like something out of Target or Walmart, and it’s also shapeless and the wrong size for Malik, doing her absolutely no favors. The sandals aren’t that cute and they clash horribly with the dress. Now, even when her outfit’s bad, Mayim’s hair is usually on point, but in this case, even her hair is bad as it is limp and boring. Okay, the Disney/Pixar ‘’World Of Cars Online’’ 2010 Launch Event wasn’t a major red carpet event, but that’s still no excuse for this outfit. That dress should’ve probably never seen the light of day!</p><h2 id=amy-farrah-fowler-s-skirt>Amy Farrah Fowler’s Skirt?</h2><p>It’s perfectly understandable that Mayim would opt for comfortable outfits in her everyday life, but there are plenty of outfits that offer comfort, but still look nice. This isn’t one of those outfits. The white long-sleeved top is fine, and the black low-top Converse sneakers&nbsp;are adorable and super-comfortable, but that skirt has to go! It seriously looks as if she raided Amy Farrah Fowler’s wardrobe on the set of The Big Bang Theory and decided to take one her skirts home with her! That skirt is seriously a crime against fashion! Especially since there are plenty of skirts out there that are of a similar length and are comfortable and practical enough to wear while running errands, but still look cute and would’ve worked with the top and Converse sneakers!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=denim-and-satin-clash>Denim And Satin Clash</h2><p>On August 8, 2012, Mayim attended the 11thAnnual InStyle Summer Soiree, which was held at The London Hotel located in West Hollywood. When you’re attending an event with the phrase ‘’in style’’ in its title, it would make sense to wear a somewhat stylish outfit, don’t you think so? Either Mayim genuinely thought that this was a stylish outfit or she just couldn’t care less. This is one of those outfits where each individual item of clothing would have been fine on its own, but when put together, they just don’t work. The denim jacket’s nice, the black satin dress is lovely, and the heels are gorgeous, but the jacket shouldn’t have been worn with either of them. The necklace is tacky and it makes the outfit look even worse.</p><h2 id=chessboard-inspired-outfit>Chessboard-Inspired Outfit</h2><p>In 2012, Mayim attended the CBS Upfront Presentation, which was held at the Lincoln Center in New York, with her The Big Bang Theory co-stars,&nbsp;Kunal Nayyar, who plays Dr. Rajesh Koothrapali, and Melissa Rauch, who plays Dr. Bernadette Rostenkowski-Horowitz. Mayim enjoys wearing quirky outfits, and while many of these outfits have been really cute, this one is just weird. It’s as if she took a stylish black dress and decided to throw a different material over it. Unfortunately, that different material looks like it came from a chessboard-inspired tablecloth! It’s also so awkward and shapeless, and the dress ends up looking ridiculous. If it didn’t have that chessboard-inspired addition, it would’ve been a gorgeous timeless outfit, and Mayim would have looked great in all-black due to her fair complexion!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=red-and-gray-flop>Red And Gray Flop</h2><p>On October 16, 2010, Mayim attended the 20th Annual Environmental Media Association Awards, which have been awarded since 1991 to the best TV shows or movies with an environmental message. Mayim is passionate about the environment and speaks on its behalf all the time, so of course, she’d attend such an event. We love that Mayim’s passionate about saving the planet (after all, she’s a scientist so she knows what she’s talking about!), but what we don’t love is the outfit that she chose to wear to this event! Red and gray are two colors that go together and that suit Mayim really well, but this outfit is hilariously frumpy— it’s something that you’d expect an elementary school teacher from a tiny town in the middle of nowhere to wear!</p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">eonline.com,</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">nydailynews.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">screenertv.com</a>,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> huffingtonpost.com&nbsp;</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYWp6rq3YoqRmmpmWuaq3jKisrZ6ZqcBuwMeaq2alkaCybsHSZqiunaOptrC6jKGcq2WWlsCptc6nZK2Zo6mycA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-mayim-bialik-outfits-that-make-us-question-her-fashion-taste.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f15-mayim-bialik-outfits-that-make-us-question-her-fashion-taste.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f15-mayim-bialik-outfits-that-make-us-question-her-fashion-taste.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f15-mayim-bialik-outfits-that-make-us-question-her-fashion-taste.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-mayim-bialik-outfits-that-make-us-question-her-fashion-taste.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-mayim-bialik-outfits-that-make-us-question-her-fashion-taste.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./celebrities-that-time-travel.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./celebrities-that-time-travel.html>Celebrities That Time Travel Exploring Sci-Fi Themes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./snl-recap-jason-momoa-tackles-roman-empire-trend-with-rap-song.html>'SNL' Recap: Jason Momoa Tackles Roman Empire Trend With Rap Song</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./snl-recap-jason-momoa-tackles-roman-empire-trend-with-rap-song.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
