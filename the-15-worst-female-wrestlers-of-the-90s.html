Rockin’ Robin was the final WWF Women’s Champion before they were all sent packing. The only ones that stuck around were Sensational Sherri and Miss Elizabeth. Both of them moved over to major managerial roles for male wrestlers. But in 1993 the WWF brought back the women’s title again and held a 6 woman tournament to crown a new champion that was won by Alundra Blayze.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Blayze was brought in to get the female division going again but Vince McMahon wouldn’t let her wrestle under her better known name of Madusa, because she had trademarked the name. It opened the door for many female wrestlers to come back into the ring as the females once again took a more prominent role inside the squared circle. But with all of the new talent coming in, not all of it could be good. So here we will take a look back at some of the worst female wrestlers of the 1990s.</p><h2 id=15-stacy-carter><strong>15. </strong><strong>Stacy Carter&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The 90s was a time that women’s wrestling was about looks above all else for the most part. And looks very rarely translate over to talent. Stacy Carter was also known as Miss Kitty and The Kat, and for a while even as Mr. Jerry Lawler. She had the looks and put them to full use in hopes that nobody would notice her lack of ring skills. As a matter of fact she was so bad that she made this list twice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After taking part in an Evening Gown Swimming Pool match in the late 90s she ripped off her bra, going topless for everyone in attendance to see, and also anyone watching on the pay-per-view. She did this twice during her time in the WWE and her wrestling skills were so bad that the only thing people remember her by are those two events.</p><p></p><h2 id=14-bertha-faye><strong>14. </strong><strong>Bertha Faye&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Bertha Faye was known as Ronda Sing before changing her name when she came to the WWE. She didn’t fit the current cast of characters in the female division who were bringing nothing but looks to the ring.</p><p>Faye actually did have some wrestling skills although she didn’t show them off during her brief stint with the company. She was much bigger than the other women and she dressed horribly in the ring. She used her weight to beat Alundra Blayze at the 1995 Summer Slam event to win the Women’s Championship but only defended it one time, two months later when she lost it back to Blayze. She held the title officially for 57 days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The few times we saw her, it was all about the size and weight advantage that she had over an opponent. We never saw the wrestling skills that she actually possessed. Because of that she makes the list. I hope Vince is proud.</p><p></p><h2 id=13-chaparita-asari><strong>13. </strong><strong>Chaparita Asari&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Asari had&nbsp;a brief stint with the WWE and never really belonged in the ring. At 5 feet tall&nbsp;and 120 pounds she just didn’t fit in the ring with anyone that had a minimal amount of talent. She was on the losing side of a Survivor Series match in 1995 and then two days later while going up against Aja Kong in a Monday Night Raw taping, she got her nose broken. Those two brutally bad matches pretty much sum up her short stay in the WWE.</p><p></p><h2 id=12-aja-kong><strong>12. </strong><strong>Aja Kong&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Kong is an icon in Japanese women’s wrestling. When she entered the ring you could tell she was all business and there weren’t many that looked forward to getting in the ring with her. She was big and strong and won many titles in her career over there, but then she came to the WWE for a short time and all of that went out the window.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While she was here she wasn’t allowed to be as violent and brutal as she was known for being in the ring. Although she did break Asari’s nose on a Monday Night Raw taping. When she was here it was just about size and weight and she never got to show off the skills that she had. Vince McMahon can take the blame for this one as well.</p><p></p><h2 id=11-debra><strong>11. </strong><strong>Debra&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Debra came over to the WWE in the late 90s from WCW and immediately replaced Sable as the company’s top sex symbol. Sable wasn’t too happy with that and eventually the two ended up in the ring for an Evening Gown match.</p><p>Sable got outside help and ripped off Debra’s dress to retain her WWE Women’s Championship but Shawn Michaels, who was the Commissioner at that point, came out and changed the ruling. He basically said that he loved how Debra looked in her bra and panties and awarded her the title.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She had no wrestling skills what so ever and her time at the top was short. But the match severely ruined the credibility of the title.</p><p></p><h2 id=10-miss-kitty><strong>10. </strong><strong>Miss Kitty&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>She wrestled as Stacy Carter, Miss Kitty, and then Kat. No matter what her name was it was obvious that she was in the ring for one reason only. She had the looks but absolutely zero wrestling skills. She was awarded the championship based on looks alone and actually took part in title defenses that were done in a Pudding Match, and another in a Snow Bunny match. No more needs to be said.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-bull-nakano><strong>9. </strong><strong>Bull Nakano&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Nakano was one of the few women that came to the WWE from Japan and was actually allowed to stick around for a little bit. In late 1994 she beat Alundra Blayze at Tokyo’s Egg Dome for the Women’s Championship and held the title for four months before fading away. She was one of the more brutal women to get in the ring at the time but had no actual wrestling skills. It was fun to watch her beat down an opponent with force but her technical skills were severely lacking.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=8-ivory><strong>8. </strong><strong>Ivory&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Ivory was in the business for more than twenty years. She started out with the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling in the 80s before joining up with the WWE during the 90s. She wasn’t real high on how the company put looks and sex appeal before actual wrestling and she took steps to try and do something about it.</p><p>She only found a little bit of success with that and won the Women’s Championship three different times, but her overall wrestling skills in the ring, while better than most, weren’t enough to bring about the changes that she wanted. Her views did inspire several other women down the road, but overall Ivory’s skills weren’t enough to bring about change.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=7-jacqueline><strong>7. </strong><strong>Jacqueline&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Jacqueline probably had the most talent of any female wrestler during the 90s. But that’s only in comparison with the others. It still wasn’t anything to brag about. She used her appearance to build a rivalry with Sable and people tuned in to the matches to see what might spill out, not because of actual skills. Jacqueline did actually improve later in her career and she actually beat Chavo Guerrero for the Cruiserweight Championship in 2004. But during the 90s and her rivalry with Sable, those skills hadn’t yet developed.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-luna-vachon><strong>6. </strong><strong>Luna Vachon&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Luna Vachon was part of some seriously bizarre story lines, even for the WWF. She made her first appearance in 1993 and became involved in several mix tag team rivalries, mostly which included Sensational Sherri and Bam Bam Bigelow. She went after the Women’s Championship which was held by Alundra Blayze at the time and failed. So she recruited Bull Nakano to go after the title and she eventually won it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Vachon then left the company soon after that was accomplished. She wasn’t much in the ring as far as skills go and she is more known for being a part of the crazy storylines than actually wrestling skills. She was also the first woman to be included in a WWF video game, despite the fact that she wanted nothing to do with it. But again, that inclusion was because of the crazy antics that she took part in, not because of what she did in the ring.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-sable><strong>5. </strong><strong>Sable&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Sable was one of the most recognizable female athletes of the 90s. But it was all based on her looks and you can’t blame her for taking advantage of the situation. But as far as inside the ring goes, she just didn’t have what it took to impress.</p><p>The company let her ride the wave because of the large popularity that she had built up, but eventually her ego got out of control, while her wrestling skills didn’t get any better. She actually had the Women’s Championship taken away from her after winning a title defense against Debra in an Evening Gown match. That’s how bad she was. The company had grown tired of her abundance of ego and lack of skills, so they just came right into the ring and took the title away from her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After that she faded away and the title no longer had any credibility. It had been losing credibility for a while based on what was happening in the ring and this was pretty much the end. Nobody took the title seriously anymore because it was very clear that the WWE was higher on sex appeal than it was on ring skills. And Sable was the perfect example of that.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-the-fabulous-moolah><strong>4. </strong><strong>The Fabulous Moolah&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>You have to give credit where credit is due. The Fabulous Moolah was around for a very long time. Making the worst wrestlers list <a href=#>for two different decades</a> is a serious accomplishment. Her matches were boring and unexciting to say the least. She did bring a vicious assault to the ring on most evenings but not many pure wrestling skills. While she was better than most, she didn’t show off the few skills that she did have very often. Winning the Women’s Championship at the age of 76 was a complete joke, just like her in the ring wrestling skills.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-stephanie-mcmahon><strong>3. </strong><strong>Stephanie McMahon&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Stephanie McMahon is an extremely smart woman outside of the ring. She has been a major factor in the company growing to the magnitude that it has. However the same can’t be said about her in-ring performance. When she won the WWF Women’s Championship she needed help from several people to take the title because she is a horrible wrestler. Nobody would have bought it if it didn’t happen that way.</p><p>Her acting skills are slightly above zero and her wrestling skills are just barely above that. Whenever she climbs into the ring to do battle, it’s a good time to change the channel and check the score of the game. You won’t have anything to worry about because you certainly won’t miss anything entertaining.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-chyna><strong>2. </strong><strong>Chyna&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Chyna was dubbed the Ninth Wonder of the World, because Andre the Giant was the eighth. Credit must be given for her physique and the energy that she brought to the ring. But the company played it much too hard and most of her stay in the WWE was obviously more along the lines of fantasy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The way she destroyed any other woman that got into the ring with her just wasn’t real. Most would have put up more of a fight than they were allowed to. And the fact that she won the Intercontinental Championship twice and was once considered the number one contender for the WWE Championship, just made everything even more unbelievable.</p><p>When she left the company in 2001, many say that she left a legacy as one of the best females in the sport ever. But that’s only because it was all given to her. She wasn’t nearly as good as everyone gives her credit for being. Was she entertaining? Yes, she absolutely was. Is she the best female in the sport's&nbsp;history? Not when you consider the fact that most of her career was not even close to being real.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-alundra-blayze><strong>1. </strong><strong>Alundra Blayze</strong></h2><p>When Madusa joined the WWE they forced her to use the name Alundra Blayze. She held the Women’s Championship three different times and much like Chyna did, she destroyed opponents that she never would have if the outcomes weren’t predetermined. Sure maybe she would have won, but not in the dominating fashion that she did most of the time.</p><p>In 1995 after she had left the WWE for WCW, she threw the WWE Women’s Championship belt into a garbage can on a Monday Nitro show. That single move showed a lack of respect to the profession that nobody has ever reached before. And it clinches her the top spot on the list.</p><p>Sources: <a href=#>thesportster.com</a>, <a href=#>whatculture.com</a>, <a href=#>wwe.com</a>, <a href=#>wikipedia.org</a>, <a href=#>profightdb.com</a>, <a href=#>bleacherreport.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0e9OhnGZpZWLEsL7SrWSfnZ2WuaZ51qucrKycmr%2B0ec6fZK2glWKGcb%2BO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-15-worst-female-wrestlers-of-the-90s.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-15-worst-female-wrestlers-of-the-90s.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-15-worst-female-wrestlers-of-the-90s.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-15-worst-female-wrestlers-of-the-90s.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-15-worst-female-wrestlers-of-the-90s.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-15-worst-female-wrestlers-of-the-90s.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./azmarie-livingston-raven-symone-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./azmarie-livingston-raven-symone-html.html>What Happened to AzMarie Livingston and Raven Symon?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./richard-net-worth.html>Richard Net Worth How Much is Richard Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./richard-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
