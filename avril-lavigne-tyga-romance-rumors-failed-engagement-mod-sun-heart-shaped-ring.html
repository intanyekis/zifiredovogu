The former drummer proposed in Paris with <a href=#>a unique heart-shaped engagement ring.</a></p><p>Lavigne took to Instagram to confirm the engagement, with her French caption reading, "Oui! Je t’aime pour toujours ð¤ðð¥Dimanche. 27. Mars. 2022.” In English, that translates to: “Yes! I love you forever."</p><p>Lavigne told People it was "most perfect, romantic proposal," and was a complete surprise. "We were in Paris on a boat in the Seine River," she says. "We had a violin player, champagne and roses. It felt like time stood still, and it was just the two of us in the moment."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mod Sun posted photos of their engagement on social media with the adorable caption, "The day we met I knew you were the one. Together forever til our days are done. I had a dream where I proposed in paris. I pulled out a ring + asked you to wear it. I was on one knee as I looked in your eyes. You're too beautiful for my words to describe. I grabbed your hand + took one last breath…I said 'will you marry me?' + she said 'yes.'"</p><p>Sadly, the pair split after ten months after being on/off for two months. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Avril and Mod Sun have been on and off for the past two months</a>, but are no longer together as a couple," a source close to the former couple told People.</p><h2 id=avril-lavigne-s-engagement-ring-from-mod-sun>Avril Lavigne's Engagement Ring From Mod Sun</h2><p>Mod Sun proposed to the Canadian singer with a custom sparkler from Beverly Hills-based jeweler XIV Karats. “It has the words ‘Hi Icon’ engraved in it, which were the first words he ever said to me. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">And it has Mod + Avril on the inside</a>,” Lavigne told People.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He worked with designer Caryn Alpert</a> — who is a close friend of Lavigne, and designs virtually all her jewels including her previous engagement rings. “He had the biggest smile on his face the whole time,” Alpert told Page Six Style about working with Mod Sun. The designer is a favorite of fellow celebrities including Lana Del Rey, <strong><a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a></strong> and Hailey Baldwin.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Avril Lavigne's Rise To Fame May Have Started Long Before 'Sk8er Boi'</a></span></p><p>“He knew that he really wanted to do something with hearts and have the most dazzling, biggest, flawless heart-shaped ring for her,” she revealed. The ring is a heart-shaped diamond, which is because when the pair first met they were both wearing matching heart-shaped paved rings. The pair always wore those matching rings as a symbol of their bond.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“They also have a connection to France and royalty, and he wanted it to look like a crown too,” the designer explained, “so there’s a lot of beautiful detail around the heart shape itself.”</p><p>The designer explains Lavigne's tastes in jewels. “She loves big — the bigger the diamond the better, of course,” Alpert says about the Canadian singer. “She’s not shy; she’s got bold but also classic, traditional and timeless taste.”</p><p>This isn't the first engagement ring to be placed on Avril's finger. In 2012, Nickelback's lead singer Chad Kroeger proposed with a 14-carat diamond reportedly worth $350,000. He later upgraded her to a 17-carat sparkler on their anniversary in 2014. <a href=#>In 2005, Sum 41’s Deryck Whibley proposed</a> with a 4-carat diamond solitaire.</p><h2 id=mod-sun-and-avril-lavigne-s-relationship-timeline>Mod Sun And Avril Lavigne's Relationship Timeline</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/avril-lavigne-mod-sun.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Avril Lavigne and Mod Sun (whose real name is Derek Smith) initially connected through music after collaborating on a song together in the studio. The "Girlfriend" singer was featured on Mod's 2021 single "Flames." He also co-wrote and co-produced several tracks on her Love Sux, album.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Long Before Those Headlines With Avril, Mod Sun Made His Own Way In Music</a></span></p><p>"I knew we had a very strong unstoppable connection from the first week of writing and working together in the studio. Immediately," Avril Lavigne explained. "He made every day better. It was like I had known him forever. As time went on, things kept getting better, and it felt incredibly natural."</p><p>Although there were rumors and the pair were spotted out together, Mod professed his love for the singer in September 2021. They made their red carpet debut at the 2021 MTV Video Music Awards. "Everything is a dream when I'm with her….." he wrote on his social media, posting photos from the awards show red carpet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mod-sun-and-avril-lavigne-s-messy-break-up>Mod Sun And Avril Lavigne's Messy Break-Up</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mod-Sun-Avril-Lavigne.jpg><p>Mod Sun and Avril Lavigne announced their split in February 2023. Soon after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Avril was seen out and about with the rapper, Tyga</a>. "Avril and Tyga are genuinely friends and nothing more. There was absolutely no third party involved in the split," a source revealed.</p><p>That same night Avril was seen out with Tyga, Sun kicked off his God Save the Teen tour in Sacramento. A rep for the singer gave a conflicting statement about the couple's relationship. "They were together and engaged as of three days ago when Mod left for tour, so if anything has changed that's news to him," the rep said.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Chad Kroeger And Avril Lavigne's Marriage And Divorce</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A week later, Mod Sun revealed his heartbreak at the split. "In 1 week my entire life completely changed…I just know there's a plan for it all," he wrote. "I'll keep my head up + always listen to my heart, even when it feels broken. I have the best friends in the entire world, thanks for always having my back."</p><p>During Mod's final show on his tour, he told the crowd that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his fans "saved" his life</a> after the split. Avril would later go official with Tyga, but they reportedly called it quits just four months after they went official in March 2023.</p><p>Avril obviously loves her bling! After Tyga and Avril's split, there were rumors that <a href=#>the singer planned to keep the $80,000 necklace</a> the rapper gifted her mere weeks after debuting their romance. The custom piece was created by Tiffany & Co. and featured 50 carats of diamonds and pink sapphires, all of which spell out Avril’s name as well as adorn bedazzle skulls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYr6qZoXqtrdWinqedXanGqK2Mq6ammZ6Ysm6%2B1Kamq6tdm66quMSdZJ6ml5a0prnEp6tmpZ%2BZerTBzWafnpmiqXq0tMCpnJ1lop67qHs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2favril-lavigne-tyga-romance-rumors-failed-engagement-mod-sun-heart-shaped-ring.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2favril-lavigne-tyga-romance-rumors-failed-engagement-mod-sun-heart-shaped-ring.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2favril-lavigne-tyga-romance-rumors-failed-engagement-mod-sun-heart-shaped-ring.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2favril-lavigne-tyga-romance-rumors-failed-engagement-mod-sun-heart-shaped-ring.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2favril-lavigne-tyga-romance-rumors-failed-engagement-mod-sun-heart-shaped-ring.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2favril-lavigne-tyga-romance-rumors-failed-engagement-mod-sun-heart-shaped-ring.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./abigail-spencer-whats-in-my-bag-201517.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./abigail-spencer-whats-in-my-bag-201517.html>Abigail Spencer: What's In My Bag?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./inside-britney-spears-massive-car-collection.html>The Britney Garage: Inside Britney Spears' Massive Car Collection</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./inside-britney-spears-massive-car-collection.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
