Dallas jumped out to an early lead as Prescott connected with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Zk5GgVex9l3q9BqS href=#>CeeDee Lamb</a> on a 13-yard pass in the first quarter to open the scoring. <a href=#>Prescott</a> followed that with a 1-yard TD pass to <a class=ath_autolink data-id=0AHLTh95vm3CvtV9 href=#>Michael Gallup</a> just before the half.</p><p><a class=ath_autolink data-id=qsrF8CVWw24iwJ2Q href=#>Rico Dowdle</a>’s 1-yard run for a score in the second quarter and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=aykbyHg70zurdiPF href=#>Brandon Aubrey</a>’s 60-yard field goal in the first helped extend the <a href=#>Cowboys</a>’ lead.</p><p>Aubrey also impressed with a 59-yard field goal in the third quarter to become the first kicker in <a class=ath_autolink data-id=2 href=#>NFL</a> history to hit two field goals from 59 yards or more in the same game. In the fourth quarter, he nailed two more field goals from 45 yards and 50 yards out.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a href=#>Eagles</a> offense struggled despite a <a class=ath_autolink data-id=iCvfhO9lbLAFYFLM href=#>Jalen Carter</a> 42-yard fumble return for a score in the third quarter. Quarterback <a class=ath_autolink data-id=yhzPJprUoEnfzPvf href=#>Jalen Hurts</a> went 18-of-27 passing for 197 yards in the loss.</p><p>With the win, the Cowboys remain undefeated at home this season and lead the conference along with the Eagles and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=58 href=#>San Francisco 49ers</a>.</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>NFL playoff picture: Dolphins blow chance to stick with Ravens atop AFC</p></a><h2>Dominant win boosts Prescott’s MVP case, Dallas’ Super Bowl hopes</h2><p>The Cowboys again showed why they are the NFL’s best team at home this season, securing their biggest win of the year by dominating the 10-win Eagles. <a href=#>Prescott</a> has now become the league MVP front-runner with another quality showing, out-playing Eagles QB Hurts. Veteran Cowboys CB <a class=ath_autolink data-id=LHHA7M8fVh0F5ywk href=#>Stephon Gilmore</a> might’ve been the biggest star of the game, turning in his best performance as a Cowboy. Aubrey continued to be incredible, making field goals of 59 and 60 yards with plenty of room to spare. Even the Dallas running game looked good. And, of course, the Dallas defense was incredible as a unit, not allowing a touchdown. This was a statement win. Even the harshest of Cowboys critics has to put them in the Super Bowl conversation after tonight. — Jon Machota, Cowboys staff writer</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Jerry Jones: Dak Prescott is 'qualified in every way' to win a Super Bowl</p></a><h2>Cowboys offense lives up to hype</h2><p>Coming into the game, the matchup most would have pointed to as the big reason for a Cowboys win would have been their relentless offense against the Eagles’ shoddy defense. The Dallas offense lived up to the billing and did its part by pouring on 33 points in the game. The Cowboys, who have struggled to run the ball most of the season, had 96 rushing yards in the first half alone. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=NxzrBEjSQFfzLIrh href=#>Jake Ferguson</a> once again came up with clutch catches, including a seam ball early, another catch-and-run in the middle later in the game on third down with Prescott being blitzed and then an acrobatic hurdle to cap off his night.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Prescott is the headliner when it comes to the Cowboys scoring points but what Aubrey did against the Eagles can’t be overlooked. The rookie kicker made four field goals and finished his night with a 50-yarder on the Cowboys’ final drive. His accuracy has been such a critical weapon all season for the Cowboys — he hasn’t missed a single field goal attempt — but now he’s showing off his range as well. The Cowboys’ offense has scored more than 30 points in six of their last seven games. The only game in that span they hadn’t scored 30 in was their 23-point output in Philadelphia, and they corrected that Sunday night. — Saad Yousuf, Cowboys staff writer</p><h2>Eagles blow critical matchup</h2><p>The Eagles had an opportunity to seize control of the NFC’s No. 1 overall seed. Instead, they fielded yet another game filled with fatal flaws, and it’s now highly questionable if this team is even capable of making another deep playoff run.</p><p>They trailed at halftime for the sixth straight game. Tonight’s 24-6 deficit was the largest yet. Their defense continued to be unreliable. After the Eagles surrendered six straight scores at the end of a 42-19 beatdown at home against the San Francisco 49ers, the Cowboys scored three touchdowns and a field goal on their four first-half possessions.</p><p>First-year defensive coordinator Sean Desai still hasn’t figured out a solid way to organize his secondary. After having cornerback <a class=ath_autolink data-id=XbcJ9BbxN4jskljf href=#>Darius Slay</a> shadow the opponent’s No. 1 receiver in the last five games, Desai chose to keep Slay on the short side of the field against the Cowboys. This often placed nickel corner <a class=ath_autolink data-id=RRUx97ATeV6i6qRE href=#>Bradley Roby</a> in the slot against Lamb. On the first drive of the game, in a third-and-2 situation, Prescott hit a wide-open Lamb for the 13-yard touchdown with Roby trailing in pursuit.</p><p>The Eagles defense remains dreadful on third downs. They entered the weekend with the NFL’s worst third-down defense (47.3 percent conversion rate). The Cowboys converted on 9 of 15 third-down situations, scored two touchdowns on third downs, and the Eagles helped the Cowboys convert two more with Slay and rookie cornerback <a class=ath_autolink data-id=n7ElvZKFJUJQivjj href=#>Kelee Ringo</a> getting flagged for separate pass interference penalties. — Brooks Kubena, Eagles staff writer</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Eagles’ margin for error decreasing after loss to Cowboys: ‘We’ve got to get our mind right’</p></a><h2>Philadelphia offense never a threat in loss</h2><p>Meanwhile, the inefficiency of the Eagles offense and its growing pile of self-inflicted mistakes are reaching critical mass. Hurts, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=EJI9GRcayoZKGPpF href=#>A.J. Brown</a> and&nbsp;<a class=ath_autolink data-id=rRK5EifpLOPY5iRv href=#>DeVonta Smith</a> each lost fumbles. The Eagles have now turned the ball over 19 times in 2023, which, through 13 games, already ties their total from 2022. Hurts has now fumbled in seven straight games.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>First-year offensive coordinator <a class=ath_autolink data-id=yPNEQsfN14vVE47K href=#>Brian Johnson</a> once again failed to assemble a game plan that fielded any sort of consistent threat. They failed to seize momentum after defensive tackle <a class=ath_autolink data-id=YShpSe5WqFm1MlqW href=#>Fletcher Cox</a> forced a sack fumble that Carter returned for a defensive touchdown at the start of the second half. Down 27-13 with 32 seconds left in the third quarter, the Eagles failed to convert on a critical fourth-and-8 situation. Hurts was hurried by a six-man Cowboys rush and threw a short crossing pattern to Smith. It appeared Brown was supposed to inhibit cornerback Gilmore’s path, but Gilmore snuck under Brown and tackled Smith short of the first down. — Kubena</p><h2>Highlight of the game</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Brandon Aubrey has RANGE 😲</p><p>The Cowboys rookie kicker is the first player in NFL history to make two field goals of 59+ yards in the same game.</p><p>🎥 <a href=#>@NFL</a><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/EHnNE4tuvG</a></p><p>— The Athletic (@TheAthletic) <a href=#>December 11, 2023</a></p><h2>Required reading</h2><p>(Photo: Richard Rodriguez / Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57lGppcGpkbXxzfJFsZmpqX2Z9cK%2FOsJmosaNisqKzy56qZqqVqMKtwIyapZqkqai2tHnNn6Nmq56bfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcowboys-eagles-result-analysis-nfl-snf.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcowboys-eagles-result-analysis-nfl-snf.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcowboys-eagles-result-analysis-nfl-snf.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcowboys-eagles-result-analysis-nfl-snf.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcowboys-eagles-result-analysis-nfl-snf.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcowboys-eagles-result-analysis-nfl-snf.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./goldie-hawn-married-husband-children-divorce-net-worth-wiki-bio.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./goldie-hawn-married-husband-children-divorce-net-worth-wiki-bio.html>Goldie Hawn Married, Husband, Children, Divorce, Net Worth, Wiki-Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./b-g-possible-prison-return-allegedly-violating-parole-1234865624.html>B.G.
