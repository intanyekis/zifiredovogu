He and his partner Kris sprung up a relationship shortly after the latter’s end of her 20-year marriage to Caitlyn Jenner. His relationship with the Kardashian momager has been pretty low-key, compared to Kris’ previous affairs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While he prefers to keep his private life away from the public, many fans wonder who he really was before being connected to the Jenner-Kardashian family. Some people accuse him of dating Kris only for fame and her money. Others think that <a href=#>he’s actually working for her</a>. Little do they know, he’s actually worth a pretty penny on his own. Here’s everything to know about Corey Gamble before becoming famous as Jenner’s beau.</p><h2 id=who-was-corey-gamble-before-kris-jenner>Who Was Corey Gamble Before Kris Jenner?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/kris-jenner-and-corey-gamble-on-a-red-carpet.jpg><p>Hailing from Atlanta, Georgia, Corey attended Westlake High School, where he was a member of the football team. Due to his ability to balance his schoolwork and sports activities, his friends called him “Mr. Dependable.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After graduating in 1999, he went to Morehouse College where he completed his degree in business marketing.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Kris Jenner Dump Corey Gamble After Cheating Rumors?</a></span></p><p>Corey relocated to Los Angeles, California, after receiving his degree to pursue a career in the music industry.</p><p>Before becoming well-known as Jenner's lover, he had already established himself in the entertainment and marketing industry <a href=#>as a corporate executive and talent manager</a>. He presently works for Scooter Braun's business, SB Projects, and thus served as Bieber's tour manager.</p><p>Clearly, working with Justin Bieber has earned Corey quite a bit of cash; he's actually a millionaire and has made more money in the past few years than he did in his entire career pre-2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=corey-gamble-is-a-millionaire>Corey Gamble Is A Millionaire</h2><p>As for his wealth, it proves that he works just as hard as Kris. <a href=#>Corey became a millionaire</a> thanks to his work as a talent manager. Aside from working with Justin, the powerhouse agent also represented music stars such as Ariana Grande and Demi Lovato.</p><p>In addition, he began appearing on the Kardashian-Jenner family’s reality show in 2015. His <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth sits at a hefty $15 million</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kris Jenner Branded As ‘Sugar Mommy’ After Luxury Vacation With Corey Gamble</a></span></p><p>In addition to being friends with Bieber, the talent manager has a number of well-known pals including Carl Lentz, the pastor of Hillsong, and hospitality tycoon David Grutman. A picture of him with fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger smoking cigars on a yacht was posted by him in 2017 on Instagram.</p><p>But among the celebrities he’s connected with, his infamous relationship with Kris Jenner has made his name more recognizable among the public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=corey-gamble-rsquo-s-relationship-with-kris-jenner-has-defied-the-odds>Corey Gamble’s Relationship With Kris Jenner Has Defied The Odds</h2><p>At a birthday celebration for fashion designer Riccardo Tisci's 40th birthday hosted by Kim's ex-boyfriend Kanye West in Ibiza in August 2014, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Corey and Kris first came into contact</a>. Soon after the occasion, Corey began to appear in Kris' photos, and the two have pretty much been inseparable ever since.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-Did-Corey-Gamble-And-Kris-Jenner-Meet.jpg><p>Rumor has it that Corey dated Sheree Buchanan, who starred on Atlanta Exes, for three years before crossing path with Kris. At the time the pair met, Kris was divorcing Caitlyn Jenner and was in the middle of the process.</p><p>It is unclear when the two made things official after meeting, but by October 2014, Gamble had joined the Kardashian family on a trip to Las Vegas for Kim’s birthday, so it is thought that Corey and Kris were dating by that point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fast-forward to 2015, the couple made their relationship Instagram-official while on a double date with Tish and Billy Ray Cyrus. Despite the 25-year age difference (Corey, who’s the same age as Kris’ second-eldest daughter Kim Kardashian, has even been called a gold digger) and some minor breakup rumors, Kris revealed in a 2021 interview that they are still going strong.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Kardashian Scene Suggests Corey Gamble And Kris Jenner May Already Be Married</a></span></p><p>When asked about their relationship, she said that Corey was an incredible support system who was loved by the rest of her family.</p><p>He’s the greatest guy, and he’s just an amazing support system for me, and he really gives me a lot of strength and insight. He’s a great sounding board. And he loves my kids and my mom, and they love him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As somewhat a response to the rumors, Corey posted a sweet birthday message for Kris. Celebrating Kris’ 66th birthday, the talent manager took to social media to share a bunch of photos from their years of togetherness.</p><p>He wrote, “Happppppy Birthday my Beautiful Queen!! Love you Deep bab. Cheers To the best mother & more decades of love and good health with u @krisjenner…”</p><p>The couple has been together since 2014 after meeting at a party. Since then, they have been open with their admiration of each other on social media, with Corey becoming a key family member.</p><p>Also, he has since been known to live a high-profile life just like the Kardashian-Jenner family. He is mostly seen in the events the family attends and is almost always present on their lavish trips.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddrK60ecKoqZ6xXZyurq7LnmSbnZakv6Z5yqugrGWamruvsdFo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-was-corey-gamble-before-kris-jenner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-was-corey-gamble-before-kris-jenner.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-was-corey-gamble-before-kris-jenner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-was-corey-gamble-before-kris-jenner.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-was-corey-gamble-before-kris-jenner.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-was-corey-gamble-before-kris-jenner.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jerry-kelly-net-worth-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jerry-kelly-net-worth-2.html>Jerry Kelly Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./chrissy-lampkin-net-worth.html>Chrissy Lampkin Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./chrissy-lampkin-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
