Although she was once linked to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>DJ&nbsp;</strong></a><b>Skrillex&nbsp;</b>and other A-listers in entertainment, these days its all about&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Caspar Jopling</a>&nbsp;</strong>for Ellie! Keep reading to learn more about their marriage, their son, and more.</p><h2>Ellie Goulding’s Husband, Caspar Jopling</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Ellie and her leading man were first reportedly linked in 2017 and kept their romance relatively off the grid until their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>engagement</a> in 2018, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cosmopolitan</a>. The now 31-year-old is an impressive art dealer who attended the Eton school, the same school as <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Prince Harry</a>&nbsp;</strong>and his brother,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Prince William</strong></a>. More so, Caspar furthered his education and attended Harvard in the United States where he studied the history of art and architecture.</p><h2>When Did Ellie & Caspar Get Married?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Caspar-Jopling-and-Ellie-Goulding-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>The “I Need Your Love” recording artist announced her engagement to Caspar in 2018. Ellie announced the exciting news via&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Times UK</a>,&nbsp;following suit of other A-listers. The announcement listed the couple as “Mr C.W.F. Jopling and Miss E.J. Goulding,” and read: “‘he engagement is announced between Caspar, son of The Hon <strong>Nicholas Jopling</strong> of Yorkshire and Mrs <strong>Jayne Warde-Aldam</strong> of Yorkshire, and Elena, daughter of Mr <strong>Arthur Goulding</strong> of Hertfordshire and Mrs <strong>Tracey Sumner</strong> of West Midlands.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Later, they held their official <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wedding ceremony</a> at York Minister Cathedral on Aug. 31, 2019. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bride</a> wore an elegant white long-sleeved gown, while Caspar opted for a traditional black suit and grey trousers. More recently, on Aug. 31, 2021, the proud husband took to Instagram to gush over his wife of two years. “One year ago today we got on a little ferry to celebrate our first anniversary together.. 12 hours (and a negroni or two) later, we found out that there was going to be a new member of the jopsquad. What an anniversary that was !!”, his sweet caption of a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo of her</a> read. “This anniversary, even with <strong>Arthur</strong> stealing so much of my heart , I love you even more than I did a year ago .. thanks a million for everything you do .. you’re pretty f**** grand :) xxx.”</p><h2>Ellie & Caspar’s Kids</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Not too long after their 2019 wedding, Ellie and her spouse announced they were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>expecting</a> their first child, a son named Arthur, in Feb. 2021. She revealed the<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> baby news</a> amid her interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vogue </a>that month. “We did the one show. I was pregnant and had no idea,” she told the outlet the same day they released photos of her growing baby bump. “It was crazy because it was our one-year anniversary. That was not the plan. The thought of getting pregnant didn’t seem like it could be a reality. Becoming pregnant kind of made me feel human. I want a better word than womanly, [but]—I have curves I’ve never had before. I’m enjoying it. My husband’s enjoying it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>By May 2, 2021, they were officially a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>family-of-three</a>! Caspar took to his Instagram Story to share a photo of a bouquet of flowers to inform everyone that their little man <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>had arrived</a>. “Mum and baby both healthy and happy,” he wrote at the time. “Extremely grateful. I don’t ever address the public attention that comes with Ellie’s job. But during this magical and personal moment we would really appreciate being able to enjoy our privacy .. Thank you x.” Most recently, on Dec. 7, 2021, he shared a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rare photo</a> of the happy family at the beach. “Miami Basel a bit different this year,” he captioned the adorable group shot.</p><h2>Who Else Has Ellie Dated?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>Prior to her romance with Caspar, Ellie was linked to a few famous musicians and artists. She notably dated Skrillex for just under a year in 2012, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>NME</a>. In addition, the proud mom was once also linked to&nbsp;War Horse&nbsp;star&nbsp;<strong>Jeremy Irvine&nbsp;</strong>from 2012 to 2013. A few other notable names on her roster include&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Niall Horan</a>&nbsp;</strong>and briefly,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ed Sheeran</strong></a>, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Capital FM</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8Slo6KdXZy8trjDoqWgZZiqwKOtzZ1kbmlgaIRzgY4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fellie-goulding-husband-5103725.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fellie-goulding-husband-5103725.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fellie-goulding-husband-5103725.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fellie-goulding-husband-5103725.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fellie-goulding-husband-5103725.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fellie-goulding-husband-5103725.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mike-hanna.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mike-hanna.html>Mike Hanna</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./marlene-dietrich-net-worth.html>Marlene Dietrich Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./marlene-dietrich-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
