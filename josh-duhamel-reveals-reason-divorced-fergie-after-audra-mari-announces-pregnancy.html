She and I have a great relationship,” Josh went on. “There wasn’t anything wrong with it. We had a great time. I think we kind of outgrew each other and had very different interests.”</p><p>“I’ve got no hard feelings for it.

The couple <a href=#>announced last month that they’re expecting baby no. 1</a> via Instagram.</p><p>Fergie made her feelings about Josh’s baby-on-the-way clear, as she left a congratulatory message for the couple, saying, “I am truly happy for you guys. Axl can’t wait to be a big brother."</p><p>Josh and Audra were vocal about their desire to have kids following their engagement in June 2022.
