<time>31 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><a href=#><strong>Jeff Lewis</strong></a> isn’t holding back when it comes to his feelings about <a href=#><strong>Jenni Pulos</strong></a> going to <a href=#>BravoCon 2023</a>.</p><p>“[Her attendance] is Bravo’s version of [the] <a href=#>Make-A-Wish Foundation</a>,” Jeff, 53, said while sitting beside <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> during the “Ask Andy” BravoCon panel on Friday, November 3, confirming that Pulos, 50, was in attendance this weekend.</p><p>Even though they both made the trip to Las Vegas for the three-day fan convention, Jeff made it very clear that there will be no reconciliation with Jenni.</p><p>“It’s not going to happen,” he declared when asked about the duo possibly making up.</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in September 2018 that <a href=#>the duo had parted ways</a> as business partners after 20 years of friendship.</p><p>“Jenni and I did have a fight, which then resulted in a rift,” Jeff confirmed during his SiriusXM radio show, Jeff Lewis Live, at the time. “She said that she had given up her acting career to work for me and that really hurt my feelings, because I felt like I have done nothing but accommodate her for her auditions and meetings and all of that.”</p><p>Months later,<a href=#> fans watched their fight unfold</a> when the season 11 finale of <a href=#>Flipping Out</a> aired that November.</p><p>“This is what I’m not going to buy into. I’m not going to buy into somehow you could have developed a career as an actress, but this job is holding you back,” Jeff said on the show after Jenni claimed she turned down roles in favor of flipping houses. “I’m not subscribing to any of that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jeff-Lewis-Jokes-Former-Costar-Jenni-Pulos-Got-Make-A-Wish-Invite-to-BravoCon.-inline-e1699040391342.jpg><p>Initially, Jeff <a href=#>admitted that he “missed” Jenni</a> during an October 2018 appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. Years later, however, he appeared to change his tune.</p><p>Jeff claimed that Jenni “changed” who she was when the cameras were rolling after she and ex-husband <strong>Chris Elwood</strong> split in 2008.</p><p>“I would say this to her face, I do believe that over the years she changed — in the sense of, not who she was off the cameras, but who she was on the cameras,” he said on Jeff Lewis Live in 2020. “Jenni was funny, she was sarcastic, she was edgy, she was dark. And then what happened was, around season 2 or season 3, when her husband left her, and it was devastating, there was an outpour, a huge outpour of condolences.”</p><p>He went on to say it was “almost like she became, kind of, <a href=#>a victim on camera</a>.” From that point on, Jeff claimed she was “more edited and more self-aware on camera.”</p><p>Jeff offered an update on his relationship with Jenni on <a href=# rel=noopener>WWHL</a> in February 2021.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I reached out to her about a year ago and did not hear back,” he recalled at the time. “I also ran into her — we were at the same restaurant, but we did not talk to each other. I had tried to send her both drinks and dessert, both of which were refused. … I got my answer there.”</p><p>With reporting by Sarah Hearon</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGenpZiuabDyKxko6ebmsButsSnpaJloKq5sL%2BMoKatZZ2WuKZ5wGauoquYYravwsitnGasn2Kvs63VqJqopl8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeff-lewis-jokes-jenni-pulos-got-make-a-wish-invite-to-bravocon.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjeff-lewis-jokes-jenni-pulos-got-make-a-wish-invite-to-bravocon.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjeff-lewis-jokes-jenni-pulos-got-make-a-wish-invite-to-bravocon.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjeff-lewis-jokes-jenni-pulos-got-make-a-wish-invite-to-bravocon.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeff-lewis-jokes-jenni-pulos-got-make-a-wish-invite-to-bravocon.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeff-lewis-jokes-jenni-pulos-got-make-a-wish-invite-to-bravocon.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lou-gehrig-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lou-gehrig-net-worth.html>Lou Gehrig Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./chris-cuomo-chronicles-scandalous-secrets-and-media-mayhem-exposed.html>Chris Cuomo Chronicles- Scandalous Secrets and Media Mayhem Exposed!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./chris-cuomo-chronicles-scandalous-secrets-and-media-mayhem-exposed.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
